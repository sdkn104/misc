# Spring Boot REST API Project

This is a minimal Spring Boot project for a REST API system. You can use this as a starting point for your development.

## Getting Started

1. Install Java (JDK 17 or later recommended).
2. Install Maven (or use the Maven wrapper).
3. Build and run the project:
   ```powershell
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

## Project Structure
- `src/main/java` - Java source code
- `src/main/resources` - Application resources
- `pom.xml` - Maven build file

## Next Steps
- Add your REST controllers in `src/main/java`
- Update `pom.xml` for additional dependencies
