REGULATION (EU) 2025/40 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 19 December 2024
on packaging and packaging waste, amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 and Directive (EU)
2019/904, and repealing Directive 94/62/EC
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),
Whereas:
(1) Products need appropriate packaging in order to be protected and easy to transport from where they are produced to
where they are used or consumed. Prevention of barriers on the internal market for packaging is key for the
functioning of the internal market for products. Fragmented rules and vague requirements cause uncertainty and
additional cost to economic operators.
(2) The Commission’s (Eurostat’s) packaging waste statistics for the period 2010-2021 indicate that packaging uses large
quantities of primary raw material (virgin materials). 40 % of plastics and 50 % of paper used in the Union is used for
packaging, and packaging represents 36 % of municipal solid waste. High and constantly increasing quantities of
packaging generated, as well as low levels of re-use and collection and poor recycling, present significant barriers to
achieving a low-carbon circular economy. This Regulation should therefore establish rules covering the entire
life-cycle of packaging, contributing to the efficient functioning of the internal market by harmonising national
measures, while preventing and reducing the adverse impacts of packaging and packaging waste on the environment
and human health. By laying down measures in line with the waste hierarchy set out in Directive 2008/98/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council (3) (‘waste hierarchy’), this Regulation should contribute to the transition to
a circular economy.
(3) European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC (4) lays down requirements for packaging, which relate to the
composition of packaging and its reusable and recoverable nature (‘essential requirements for packaging’), and sets
recovery and recycling targets for Member States.
(4) In 2014, in its Fitness check relating to Directive 94/62/EC, the Commission recommended adaptations to the
essential requirements for packaging, which were seen as a key tool to achieve better environmental performance of
packaging, to make those requirements more concrete and more easily enforceable and to strengthen them.
(5) In line with the European Green Deal, set out in the communication of the Commission of 11 December 2019, the
new Circular Economy Action Plan for a cleaner and more competitive Europe (CEAP), set out in the communication
of the Commission of 11 March 2020, commits to reinforcing the essential requirements for packaging with a view
to making all packaging reusable or recyclable by 2030, and to considering other measures to reduce (over)

(2) Position of the European Parliament of 24 April 2024 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and decision of the Council of
16 December 2024.
(3) Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain
Directives (OJ L 312, 22.11.2008, p. 3).

packaging and packaging waste, drive design for re-use and recyclability of packaging, reduce the complexity of
packaging materials and introduce requirements for recycled content in plastic packaging. The CEAP also highlights
the need to reduce food waste. The Commission commits to assess the feasibility of Union-wide labelling that
facilitates the correct separation of packaging waste at source.
(6) Plastic is the most carbon-intensive packaging material and, in terms of fossil fuel use, recycling of plastic waste is
approximately five-times better than incineration with energy recovery. As stated in the European Strategy for
Plastics in a Circular Economy, set out in the communication of the Commission of 16 January 2018, the CEAP
commits to increase uptake of recycled plastics and contribute to the more sustainable use of plastics. The Union
budget and the system of own resources contribute to reducing pollution from plastic packaging waste. From
1 January 2021, Council Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053 (5) introduced a national contribution that is
proportional to the quantity of plastic packaging waste that is not recycled in each Member State. That own resource
forms part of the incentives to reduce the consumption of single-use plastics, foster recycling and boost the circular
economy.
(7) The Council, in its conclusions on ‘Making the Recovery Circular and Green’ adopted on 11 December 2020,
underlined that the revision of Directive 94/62/EC should update and establish more concrete, effective and
easy-to-implement provisions in order to foster sustainable packaging in the internal market and to minimise the
complexity of packaging, in order to foster economically feasible solutions, to improve the reusability and
recyclability of packaging, as well as to minimise substances of concern in packaging materials, especially in food
packaging materials. The Council also stressed that the revision of Directive 94/62/EC should also provide for
labelling of packaging in an easily understandable way to inform consumers about the recyclability of packaging and
where packaging waste should be discarded to facilitate recycling.
(8) The European Parliament’s resolution of 10 February 2021 on the New Circular Economy Action Plan (6) reiterated
the objective of making all packaging reusable or recyclable in an economically viable way by 2030 and called on the
Commission to present a legislative proposal revising Directive 94/62/EC which would include waste reduction
measures and targets and ambitious essential requirements to reduce excessive packaging, including in e-commerce,
improve recyclability and minimise the complexity of packaging, increase recycled content, phase out hazardous and
harmful substances, and promote re-use.
(9) This Regulation complements Regulation (EU) 2024/1781 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), under
which packaging is not addressed as a specific product category. However, it should be recalled that it is possible for
delegated acts adopted on the basis of Regulation (EU) 2024/1781 to establish additional or more detailed
requirements for packaging for specific products, in particular in relation to packaging minimisation where the
design or re-design of products can lead to packaging that is environmentally less impactful.
(10) This Regulation should apply to all packaging placed on the market in the Union and to all packaging waste,
regardless of the type of packaging or the material used. For reasons of legal clarity, the definition of packaging
under Directive 94/62/EC should be restructured without changing the substance. Sales packaging, grouped
packaging and transport packaging should be defined separately. Duplication of terminology should be avoided. In
this Regulation therefore sales packaging corresponds to primary packaging, grouped packaging to secondary
packaging and transport packaging to tertiary packaging.
(11) Cups, food containers, sandwich bags or other items which can perform a packaging function should not be
considered to be packaging where they are designed and intended to be sold empty by the final distributor. Such
items should only be considered to be packaging where they are designed and intended to be filled at the point of
sale, in which case they should be considered to be ‘service packaging’, or sold by the final distributor containing
food and beverages, provided that they perform a packaging function.

repealing Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom (OJ L 424, 15.12.2020, p. 1).

(7) Regulation (EU) 2024/1781 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 establishing a framework for the setting
of ecodesign requirements for sustainable products, amending Directive (EU) 2020/1828 and Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 and
repealing Directive 2009/125/EC (OJ L, 2024/1781, 28.6.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1781/oj).
(12) The definition of primary production packaging should not entail an expansion of products being considered to be
packaging under this Regulation. The introduction of that definition and its use in the definition of ‘producer’ should
ensure that the natural or legal person making that kind of packaging available for the first time is considered to be
the producer under this Regulation and not the primary sector businesses, such as farmers, using that kind of
packaging.
(13) An item which is an integral part of a product and is necessary to contain, support or preserve that product
throughout its lifetime and where all elements of that item are intended to be used, consumed or disposed of
together should not be considered to be packaging given that its functionality is intrinsically linked to it being part of
the product. However, in light of the disposal behaviour of consumers regarding tea and coffee bags as well as coffee
or tea system single-serve units, which, in practice, are disposed of together with the product residue, leading to the
contamination of compostable and recycling streams, those specific items should be treated as packaging. That
approach is in line with the objective to increase the separate collection of bio-waste, as required by Article 22 of
Directive 2008/98/EC, and ensures coherence regarding end-of-life financial and operational obligations. Paints,
inks, varnishes, lacquers and adhesives that have been applied directly on a product should not be considered to be
packaging. However, labels hung directly on or affixed to a product, including sticky labels affixed to fruits and
vegetables, should be considered to be packaging, since, while the glue on the label is adhesive, the label itself is not.
Furthermore, if a given material represents only an insignificant part of a packaging unit, and in any event no more
than 5 % of the total mass of the packaging unit, such a packaging unit should not be considered to be composite
packaging. The definition of composite packaging in this Regulation should not exempt single-use packaging
partially made of plastics, regardless of the threshold level, from the requirements of Directive (EU) 2019/904 of the
European Parliament and of the Council (8).
(14) Packaging should be placed on the market only if it complies with the sustainability requirements and labelling
requirements laid down in or pursuant to this Regulation. Packaging should be considered to have been placed on
the market when the packaging is made available for the first time on the Union market, which means supplied by
the manufacturer or importer for distribution, consumption or use in the course of a commercial activity, whether in
return for payment or free of charge. Thus, packaging already placed on the Union market before the date of
application of relevant requirements and in the stocks of distributors, including retailers and wholesalers, should not
need to meet the sustainability and labelling requirements laid down in or pursuant to this Regulation.
(15) In line with the waste hierarchy and with life-cycle thinking to deliver the best overall environmental outcome, the
measures provided for in this Regulation should aim to reduce the quantity of packaging placed on the market in
terms of its volume and weight, to prevent packaging waste from being generated, in particular through packaging
minimisation, avoiding packaging where it is not needed and increasing re-use of packaging. In addition, the
measures provided for in this Regulation should aim to increase the use of recycled content in packaging, in
particular in plastic packaging, where the uptake of recycled content is very low, by strengthening high-quality
recycling systems, thereby increasing recycling rates for all packaging and improving the quality of the resulting
secondary raw materials while reducing other forms of recovery and final disposal.
(16) In line with the waste hierarchy, which places waste disposal through landfills as the least preferred option, the
measures provided for in this Regulation should aim to reduce the quantity of landfill of packaging waste.
(17) Packaging should be designed, manufactured and commercialised in such a way as to allow for its re-use as many
times as possible or for high-quality recycling, and to minimise its impact on the environment during its entire
life-cycle and the life-cycle of the products for which it was designed. In order to achieve that objective, the power to
adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be
delegated to the Commission in respect of establishing a minimum number of rotations for reusable packaging for
the packaging formats which are most frequently used in re-use.
(18) In line with the objectives of the CEAP and the Commission’s communication of 14 October 2020 ‘Chemicals
Strategy for Sustainability Towards a Toxic-Free Environment’ (‘Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability’), and to ensure
the sound management of chemicals throughout their life-cycle and the transition to a toxic-free and circular
economy, and considering the relevance of packaging in everyday life, it is necessary that this Regulation address the
impact of packaging on human health, the environment and on broader sustainability performance throughout its
OJ L, 22.1.2025 EN
ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj 3/124
(8) Directive (EU) 2019/904 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the reduction of the impact of certain
plastic products on the environment (OJ L 155, 12.6.2019, p. 1).
whole life-cycle, including circularity, resulting from the presence of substances of concern throughout the whole
life-cycle of packaging, from manufacture to use and end-of-life, including waste management.
(19) Taking into consideration scientific and technological progress, packaging should be designed and manufactured in
such a way as to limit the presence of certain heavy metals and other substances of concern in its composition. As
stated in the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability, substances of concern are to be minimised and substituted as far
as possible, phasing out the most harmful ones for non-essential societal use, in particular in consumer products.
Accordingly, substances of concern as constituents of packaging material or of packaging components should be
minimised with the objective to ensure that packaging, as well as materials recycled from packaging, do not have any
adverse effect on human health or the environment throughout their life-cycle.
(20) Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of thousands of synthetic chemicals that are used widely in
the Union as well as in the rest of the world in a broad range of applications. Regarding PFAS tonnage, food-contact
material and packaging is one of the most relevant sectors. All PFAS within the scope of this Regulation are either
very persistent themselves or degrade into very persistent PFAS in the environment. When looking specifically at
those human health endpoints that are considered to be of most concern following long-term exposure of humans, i.
e. carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, reproductive toxicity, including effects on or via lactation, and specific target organ
toxicity, a large number of PFAS have a classification for at least one of those endpoints. Based on the physical
properties of PFAS, particularly their persistence, together with the identified effects on health of some PFAS, PFAS
represent an environmental and human health hazard.
(21) PFAS in food-contact materials will inevitably lead to the exposure of humans to PFAS. Due to the non-threshold
nature of the PFAS hazards, exposure to PFAS from food-contact materials is an unacceptable risk for human health.
PFAS should therefore be restricted in food-contact packaging. In order to avoid overlaps with restrictions on the use
of PFAS laid down in other Union legal acts, the Commission should carry out an evaluation to assess the need to
amend or repeal the restriction of PFAS in food-contact packaging laid down in this Regulation.
(22) Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical compound used in the manufacture of materials that come into contact with food,
such as reusable plastic kitchenware or linings for cans, mainly as a protective layer. Exposure to BPA, which can
occur through its migration into food and drink and subsequent ingestion by consumers, can pose a risk to
consumers even at low levels, according to an assessment published in 2023 by the European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA).
(23) In the light of the ongoing procedure on BPA, in accordance with the powers conferred on the Commission under
Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) on food-contact materials,
a restriction on the use of BPA is expected to be adopted before the end of 2024. Once adopted, the restriction on
the use of BPA will apply to all food packaging and to other food-contact materials, with a general transition period
of 18 months.
(24) In line with the EU Action Plan: ‘Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil’, set out in the communication of the
Commission of 12 May 2021, Union policies should be based on the principle that preventive action should be
taken at source. In the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability, the Commission underlines that Regulations (EC)
No 1907/2006 (10) and (EC) No 1272/2008 (11) of the European Parliament and of the Council should be reinforced
as the cornerstones for regulating chemicals in the Union and that they should be complemented by coherent
approaches to assess and manage chemicals in existing sectorial law. Substances in packaging and in packaging

(9) Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on materials and articles
intended to come into contact with food and repealing Directives 80/590/EEC and 89/109/EEC (OJ L 338, 13.11.2004, p. 4).
(10) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration,
Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive
1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council
Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC (OJ L 396, 30.12.2006,
p. 1).
(11) Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and
packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation
(EC) No 1907/2006 (OJ L 353, 31.12.2008, p. 1).
components are therefore restricted at source and primarily addressed under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 in
accordance with the rules and procedures laid down under Title VIII of that Regulation, in order to protect human
health and the environment along all stages of the life-cycle of the substance, including the waste stage. Hence, it
should be recalled that Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 applies to the adoption or amendment of restrictions on
substances manufactured for use or used in the production of packaging or packaging components as well as on the
placing on the market of substances present in packaging or packaging components. As regards packaging that falls
within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004, it should be recalled that that Regulation aims to ensure a high
level of protection of the consumers of packaged food. Furthermore, it is possible that substances in packaging, in
packaging components or in packaging waste are also subject to restrictions laid down in other Union legal acts,
such as restrictions and prohibitions established for persistent organic pollutants under Regulation (EU) 2019/1021
of the European Parliament and of the Council (12).
(25) In addition to the restrictions applicable to food-contact materials and articles set out in Annex XVII to Regulation
(EC) No 1907/2006, and in Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004, it is appropriate, for reasons of consistency, to maintain
existing restrictions for lead, cadmium, mercury and hexavalent chromium present in packaging or packaging
components.
(26) Conditions for derogations in respect of the concentrations of lead, cadmium, mercury and hexavalent chromium
present in packaging or packaging components are established in Commission Decisions 2001/171/EC (13) and
2009/292/EC (14), adopted under Directive 94/62/EC, and should be maintained under this Regulation. However, in
order to take account of scientific and technical progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290
TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of lowering the concentrations for any of those metals laid
down in this Regulation or determining the conditions under which the sum of the concentrations of those metals is
not to apply to recycled materials or to product loops which are in a closed and controlled chain or to certain
packaging types or formats of packaging. On the basis of the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability, the same
concentrations for hazardous substances should, as a principle, apply for virgin and recycled material. However,
there may be exceptional circumstances where a derogation from that principle might be necessary. Those
exceptional circumstances justifying different concentrations for recycled material compared to primary raw
material should be based on a case-by-case analysis. When amending the existing exemptions in respect of the
concentrations of lead, cadmium, mercury and hexavalent chromium, the Commission should take that principle
into consideration.
(27) Without prejudice to the restriction of PFAS, this Regulation should not provide for the possibility of imposing
restrictions on the use of substances based on reasons of chemical safety or for reasons related to food safety, unless
there is an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment, including, but not limited to, the restrictions on
lead, cadmium, mercury and hexavalent chromium that were already established on the basis of Directive 94/62/EC
and that should be maintained under this Regulation, given that such restrictions are addressed under other Union
legal acts. It should nevertheless also allow for the restriction, primarily for reasons other than chemical or food
safety, on substances present in packaging and packaging components or used in their manufacturing processes,
which negatively affect the sustainability of packaging, in particular as regards its circularity, especially re-use or
recycling processes.
(28) Packaging that is designed with the objective of its recycling, once it becomes packaging waste, is one of the most
efficient ways to improve packaging circularity and raise packaging recycling rates and the use of recycled content in
packaging. Industry, through voluntary industry schemes, and some Member States have established packaging
design for recycling criteria for a number of packaging formats for the purpose of the modulation of extended
producer responsibility fees. In order to prevent barriers on the internal market and to provide industry with a level
playing field, and with the objective to promote the sustainability of packaging, it is important to set mandatory
requirements regarding the recyclability of packaging by harmonising the criteria and the methodology for assessing

(12) Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on persistent organic pollutants (OJ
L 169, 25.6.2019, p. 45).
(13) Commission Decision 2001/171/EC of 19 February 2001 establishing the conditions for a derogation for glass packaging in relation
to the heavy metal concentration levels established in Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (OJ L 62, 2.3.2001,
p. 20).
(14) Commission Decision 2009/292/EC of 24 March 2009 establishing the conditions for a derogation for plastic crates and plastic
pallets in relation to the heavy metal concentration levels established in Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council on packaging and packaging waste (OJ L 79, 25.3.2009, p. 44).
packaging recyclability based on a design for recycling methodology at Union level. In order to meet the objective set
out in the CEAP that, by 2030, all packaging should be recyclable in an economically viable manner, recyclable
packaging should be designed for material recycling and, when it becomes waste, be capable of being collected
separately, sorted into specific waste streams without affecting the recyclability of other waste streams and recycled
at scale. Packaging recyclability should be expressed in recyclability performance grades established on the basis of
design for recycling criteria from 2030 and on the basis of both design for recycling and recycled-at-scale criteria
from 2035 for packaging categories as listed in Annex II and expressed in grades A, B or C. Packaging of those
grades should be considered to be recyclable and, consequently, be allowed to be placed on the market. Packaging
below grade C should be considered to be technically non-recyclable and the placing on the market of such
packaging should be restricted. However, packaging should comply with those criteria only from 1 January 2030 in
order to give sufficient time to the economic operators to adapt. From 1 January 2038, packaging should be at least
grade B in order to be placed on the market.
(29) The definition of material recycling in this Regulation should complement the definitions of recycling and material
recovery set out in Directive 2008/98/EC. Material recycling keeps resources in circulation within the material
economy and should therefore not include the biological treatment of waste. The definition of material recycling
should not affect the calculation of the recycling targets set for Member States under this Regulation. Those targets
and their calculation are based on the definition of recycling set out in Directive 2008/98/EC.
(30) High-quality recycling implies that the recycled materials, based on their preserved technical characteristics, are of
equivalent or higher quality compared to the original material and can be used as a substitute for primary raw
materials for packaging or similar applications. The recycled material can be recycled multiple times. To enable the
production of high-quality recycled raw materials, the collection of properly sorted packaging waste is crucial. The
difference between material recycling and high-quality recycling is that in material recycling the packaging material is
recycled into materials, while in high-quality recycling the packaging material is recycled into materials of such
quality that those materials can be used as the same quality grade for packaging or for other applications where the
quality of the recycled material is retained.
(31) The fact that a design for recycling assessment has been carried out does not, in itself, ensure that packaging is
recycled in practice. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing
powers should be conferred on the Commission to establish a uniform methodology and a chain of custody
mechanism that ensures that the packaging waste is effectively recycled at scale, based on established state-of-the-art
separate collection processes and on established sorting and recycling processes that have been proven in an
operational environment. Consequently, from 2035, a new assessment should be carried out based on the quantity,
i.e. the weight, of the material effectively recycled from each of the packaging categories according to the
methodology and thresholds set in this Regulation. The thresholds for recycled at scale should be set taking into
account the target for the annual quantity of recycled material provided for in this Regulation. By 2030, Member
States are expected to have already reported to the Commission the first data on quantities of packaging waste
recycled by packaging category for the purposes of monitoring. The producers, in the case of individual fulfilment of
extended producer responsibility obligations, the producer responsibility organisations entrusted with the fulfilment
of those obligations or the packaging waste management operators, in the case where public authorities are
responsible for the organisation of the management of packaging waste, should make sure that the packaging waste
is collected separately, sorted and that the material is recycled in installed infrastructure, using established processes
that have been proven in an operational environment, and should provide the manufacturer with all the technical
documentation demonstrating that packaging is recycled at scale.
(32) In order to establish harmonised rules on packaging design to ensure its recyclability, the power to adopt acts in
accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of establishing design for
recycling criteria and recyclability performance grades, establishing how to perform recyclability performance
assessment and express its result, establishing a description of the conditions for compliance of each packaging
category with its respective recyclability performance grades, establishing a framework concerning the modulation
of financial contributions to be paid by producers to comply with their extended producer responsibility obligations,
as well as amending the related Annexes to this Regulation.
(33) In order to stimulate innovation in packaging, packaging which presents innovative features resulting in significant
improvement in the core function of packaging and that has demonstrable environmental benefits should be given
EN OJ L, 22.1.2025
6/124 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj
an additional time to comply with the recyclability requirements. The innovative features should be justified,
especially as regards the use of new materials, and the planned establishment of a recycling path should be explained
in the technical documentation accompanying the packaging. That information should be used, inter alia, where
necessary, to amend the implementing acts on design for recycling criteria. The economic operator should also
notify the Commission and the competent authority before placing innovative packaging on the market.
(34) In order to protect human and animal health and safety, due to the nature of the packaged products and the related
requirements, the recyclability requirements should not be mandatory for immediate packaging in accordance with
Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (15) and with Regulation (EU) 2019/6 of the
European Parliament and of the Council (16), which is in direct contact with the medicinal product, as well as outer
packaging as defined in those legislative acts in cases where such packaging is necessary to comply with specific
requirements to preserve the quality of the medicinal product. In addition, the recyclability requirements should not
be mandatory for contact-sensitive plastic packaging for medical devices covered by Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of
the European Parliament and of the Council (17), contact-sensitive plastic packaging for in vitro diagnostics medical
devices covered by Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), contact-sensitive
plastic packaging for foods intended for infants and young children and food for special medical purposes covered
by Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (19) or for packaging used for the
transport of dangerous goods in accordance with Directive 2008/68/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council (20). Sales packaging made from lightweight wood, cork, textile, rubber, ceramic or porcelain should also be
exempted, since those materials are placed on the market in very small quantities, i.e. each category amounts to less
than 1 % of the weight of the packaging placed on the Union market. The obligation to pay financial contributions in
accordance with the extended producer responsibility should not be covered by that exemption.
(35) Some Member States are taking action to encourage packaging recyclability through modulation of extended
producer responsibility fees. Such initiatives taken at the national level can create regulatory uncertainty for
economic operators, in particular those that supply packaging in several Member States. At the same time, the
modulation of extended producer responsibility fees is an effective economic instrument to incentivise more
sustainable packaging design leading to more easily recyclable packaging while improving the functioning of the
internal market. It is therefore necessary to harmonise criteria for the modulation of extended producer
responsibility fees based on the recyclability performance grade obtained through the recyclability assessment, while
not setting the actual amounts of such fees. As the criteria should be related to the criteria on packaging recyclability,
it is appropriate to empower the Commission to adopt such harmonised criteria at the same time as establishing the
detailed design for recycling criteria per packaging category.
(36) To ensure packaging circularity, packaging should be designed and manufactured in such a way as to allow for the
increased substitution of primary raw materials with recycled materials. The increased use of recycled materials
supports the development of the circular economy with well-functioning markets for recycled materials, reduces
costs, dependencies and negative environmental impacts related to the use of primary raw materials, and allows for
a more resource-efficient use of materials. In relation to the different packaging materials, the lowest input of
recycled materials is in plastic packaging. In order to address these concerns in the most appropriate manner, it is
necessary to increase the uptake of recycled plastics by establishing mandatory targets for recycled content in plastic

(38) In order to ensure a high level of protection of human and animal health in accordance with Union law, and to avoid
any risk to the security of supply or to the safety of medicinal products and medical devices, certain types of plastic
packaging should be excluded from the obligation of having a minimum recycled content. Those types of plastic
packaging are immediate packaging as defined in Directive 2001/83/EC and in Regulation (EU) 2019/6,
contact-sensitive plastic packaging for medical devices covered by Regulation (EU) 2017/745, contact-sensitive
packaging for in vitro diagnostic medical devices covered by Regulation (EU) 2017/746, contact-sensitive plastic
packaging for food intended only for infants and young children and contact-sensitive plastic packaging for food for
special medical purposes covered by Regulation (EU) No 609/2013. That exclusion should also apply to outer
packaging for human and veterinary medicinal products as defined in Regulation (EU) 2019/6 and Directive
2001/83/EC in cases where the packaging has to comply with specific requirements to preserve the quality of the
medicinal product.
(39) In order to achieve the targets for the integration of recycled content under this Regulation, the Commission should
publish, no later than 3 years after the entry into force of this Regulation, a review of the state of technological
development and environmental performance of biobased plastic packaging, and, where appropriate, present
a legislative proposal with sustainability requirements and targets.
(40) In order to prevent barriers on the internal market and to ensure the efficient implementation of this Regulation,
economic operators should ensure that any plastic part in packaging contains a certain minimum percentage of
recycled content recovered from post-consumer plastic waste, per packaging type and format as referred to in this
Regulation, calculated as an average per manufacturing plant and year.
(41) Using the manufacturing plant as a basis for calculation provides the packaging manufacturer with some flexibility
in reaching the minimum percentage of recycled content. The manufacturing plant should be understood as
referring only to one industrial facility where packaging is manufactured.
(42) There should be an incentive for economic operators to increase the recycled content in the plastic part of
packaging. One way to achieve this is to ensure the modulation of extended producer responsibility fees based on the
percentage of recycled content in packaging. The fee modulation in such cases should be based on common rules for
the calculation and verification of the recycled content contained in such packaging. In that context, Member States
should be allowed to maintain existing systems granting prior and fair access to recycled material in order to meet
the minimum recycled content targets provided that they comply with this Regulation. Furthermore, priority access
should be granted at market prices for the recycled materials and the quantity of recyclates to which priority access is
given should correspond to the quantity of packaging made available on the territory of the Member State concerned
by the economic operator within a specified timeframe.
(43) Implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in order to ensure uniform conditions for the
implementation of the rules on calculating and verifying the percentage of recycled content obtained from the
recovery of post-consumer plastic waste, calculated per packaging type and format as an average per manufacturing
plant and year while taking into consideration the environmental impact of the recycling process, and to establish
the format for technical documentation.

(44) In order to provide an internal market for high-quality recycling of plastics and the use of secondary raw materials,
any plastic part in packaging placed on the market should contain a certain minimum percentage of recycled content
recovered from post-consumer plastic waste, per packaging type and format as referred to in this Regulation,
calculated as an average per manufacturing plant and year. The packaging type should be understood as referring to
the predominant polymer the packaging is made of, while packaging format should be understood as referring to the
size and shape of a specific packaging unit.
(45) A high level of protection of environment and human health, in particular with regard to the level of emissions into
the air, water and soil, is necessary for several reasons. First, climate change is a global phenomenon that has no
boundaries and its effects do not have a direct connection to the source of the emissions of greenhouse gases:
countries with low emissions of greenhouse gases can experience effects of climate change that are disproportionate
to their individual contributions to the global emissions of greenhouse gases. Second, water systems are
interconnected, for example via oceanic currents, and past experience shows that pollution, including plastic waste
pollution, happening in one part of the planet can spread widely to other oceans and continents. Third, emissions
into the soil can have not only local, but also transboundary effects, especially when those emissions pass into the
watercourses. The promotion of the use of recycled content in plastic packaging is based on the premise that the
recycled content itself was produced in an environmentally sustainable way, so that the carbon footprint is reduced
and the circular economy is encouraged. To that end, certain safeguards need to be put in place in order to ensure
that the way in which recycled content is obtained does not cancel out the environmental benefits of using such
recycled content in subsequent plastic packaging. It is therefore necessary to address the related environmental
concerns in a non-discriminatory manner with regard to both domestically produced and imported plastic
packaging. To that end, imports into the Union should be subject to equivalent conditions with regard to emissions
and separate collection and sustainability criteria for recycling technologies.
(46) The separate collection of plastic waste is essential, as it has a direct, positive impact on the collection rate, on the
quality of the collected material and on the quality of the recyclates. It enables high-quality recycling and boosts the
uptake of quality secondary raw materials. Moving closer to a ‘recycling society’ helps to avoid waste generation and
encourages the use of waste as a resource, while avoiding locking in resources at the lower levels of the waste
hierarchy with detrimental effects on the environment and disregarding environmentally sound management of
waste. Separate collection also avoids mixing hazardous and non-hazardous waste, ensuring the safety of the waste
and of its shipment, and avoids pollution, as provided by international rules such as the Basel Convention on the
control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal (22) of 22 March 1989, the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (23), the Convention on the Prevention of Marine
Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, done in London on 29 December 1972, and its 1996 Protocol,
and Annex V to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships of 2 November 1973
(MARPOL), as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto.
(47) Furthermore, discussions at international level within the different meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating
Committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine
environment under the auspices of the United Nations Environmental Programme (‘INC on Plastic Pollution’), have
demonstrated at international level the need to step up action concerning the separate collection of plastics to limit
their environmental impacts and to boost the circular economy in order to prevent the generation of waste and
reduce the exploitation of natural resources. They also demonstrated the will of the contracting parties to adopt
measures in that direction. The Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution (24), done in Geneva on
14 November 1979, requires the parties to that Convention to protect the environment against air pollution and to
endeavour to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution, including long-range
transboundary air pollution. Under the Convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and
international lakes (25), done in Helsinki on 17 March 1992, the parties are required to take measures to prevent,
control and reduce any transboundary impact of water pollution. In line with the 1992 Rio Declaration of the
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the polluter should, in principle, bear the cost of
pollution. Hence, industrial activities such as recycling of plastic, should go hand in hand with pollution prevention
and reduction measures.

(48) The environmental objective of encouraging the use of materials recovered from post-consumer plastic waste
requires plastic recycling to be done in a way that minimises the resulting pollution. If this does not occur, the
industrial pollutants emitted in the course of recycling would reduce or eliminate the environmental added value of
encouraging the use of recycled plastic. Sustainability criteria should be developed with regard to recycling
technologies for post-consumer plastic waste. They should ensure a high level of protection of environment and
human health, in particular with regard to the level of emissions into the air, water and soil, and to resource
efficiency. For that purpose, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the
Commission in respect of establishing sustainability criteria for plastic recycling technologies. Accordingly, recycling
should be performed in an environmentally sound manner, leading to the high quality of recycling processes and
products and ensuring high standards for the recycling sector. By ensuring the appropriate level of sustainability of
the recycling technology and, consequently, the recyclate, the encouragement of the use of recycled content in plastic
packaging becomes an environmentally responsible measure. Discussions during the meetings of the INC on Plastic
Pollution also stressed the importance of ensuring that recycling technologies operate in an environmentally sound
manner.
(49) The methodology for assessing, verifying and certifying, including through third-party audit, the equivalence of the
rules applied where recycled content recovered from post-consumer plastic waste is recycled or collected in a third
country should ensure a high level of protection of environment and human health, in particular with regard to the
level of emissions into the air, water and soil, taking into account the need to ensure that recycling is performed in an
environmentally sound manner, the possibility to ensure high-quality recycling, the level of the quality standards for
the recycling sector, and the level of resource efficiency. Such considerations are key to achieving circularity of
resources, thereby putting less pressure on exhaustible natural resources. In order to ensure uniform conditions for
the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to establish
that methodology.
(50) Food-contact materials containing recycled plastic have to meet the requirements set out in Commission Regulation
(EU) 2022/1616 (26), which includes requirements on recycling technologies. Regarding plastic packaging, except
where that packaging is made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), it is appropriate to re-assess the availability of
suitable recycling technologies for such plastic packaging sufficiently ahead of the date of application of the related
recycled content requirements. That assessment should also cover the state of authorisation under relevant Union
rules and the installation in practice of such technology. Based on that assessment, there might be a need to provide
for derogations from the recycled content requirements for specific contact-sensitive plastic packaging or to amend
the list of exceptions laid down in this Regulation. To that end, the power to adopt acts in accordance with
Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission.
(51) In order to take into account the risks related to a possible insufficient supply of a specific plastic waste for recycling
that might lead to excessive prices or adverse effects on health, safety and the environment, the power to adopt acts
in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of adjusting the minimum
percentages of recycled content recovered from post-consumer plastic waste. In evaluating the justification of such
a delegated act, the Commission should assess well-reasoned requests from natural and legal persons.
(52) For materials other than plastic, such as glass or aluminium, the trend to replace primary raw material with recycled
materials is evident and expected to continue because of the development in the legal and economic environment
and the consumers` expectations. Nonetheless, the Commission should monitor closely the use of recycled content
in packaging materials other than plastics and should assess the appropriateness of proposing to establish further
measures, including the setting of targets, aiming to increase the use of recycled content in packaging other than
plastic packaging.
(53) The bio-waste waste stream is often contaminated with conventional plastics and the material recycling streams are
often contaminated with compostable plastics. This cross-contamination leads to waste of resources and lower
quality secondary raw materials and should be prevented at source. In light of that concern, Member States should
specify the appropriate waste management on their territory for compostable packaging. As the proper disposal
route for compostable plastic packaging is becoming increasingly confusing for consumers, it is justified and
necessary to lay down clear and common rules on the use of compostable plastic packaging, mandating it only when
its use brings a clear benefit for the environment or for human health. This is particularly the case when the use of
EN OJ L, 22.1.2025
10/124 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj
(26) Commission Regulation (EU) 2022/1616 of 15 September 2022 on recycled plastic materials and articles intended to come into
contact with foods, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 282/2008 (OJ L 243, 20.9.2022, p. 3).
compostable packaging helps collect or dispose of bio-waste, for example for products where the separation between
the content and packaging is particularly complex, such as tea bags.
(54) For limited packaging applications made of biodegradable plastic polymers, there is a demonstrable environmental
benefit in using compostable packaging which enters composting plants, including anaerobic digestion facilities
under controlled conditions. Furthermore, where a Member State applies Article 22(1), second subparagraph, of
Directive 2008/98/EC and appropriate waste collection schemes and waste treatment infrastructures are available in
that Member State, there should be flexibility for that Member State to decide whether to allow the making available
on its territory for the first time of compostable packaging for coffee, tea or other beverage system single-serve units
that are composed of packaging material other than metal, and very lightweight plastic carrier bags, lightweight
plastic carrier bags and the making available on their territory for the first time of other packaging that was subject
to a requirement to be compostable before the date of application of this Regulation. In order to avoid consumer
confusion about the correct disposal route, and considering the environmental benefit of circularity of carbon, all
other packaging should go into material recycling and the design of such packaging should ensure that it does not
affect the recyclability of other waste streams.
(55) In addition, biodegradable waste should not lead to the presence of contaminants in the compost produced. The
requirements of harmonised standard EN 13432:2000 ‘Packaging – Requirements for packaging recoverable by
composting and biodegradation – Test scheme and evaluation criteria for final acceptance of packaging’ should be
revised with regard to composting times, permissible levels of contamination and restrictions on the release of
microplastic to allow those materials to be processed in bio-waste treatment facilities in an appropriate manner. In
addition, a similar standard for home composting should be established in the Union.
(56) As described in the ‘EU policy framework on biobased, biodegradable and compostable plastics’, set out in the
communication of the Commission of 30 November 2022, compliance with standards for industrial composting
does not imply decomposition in home composting. In industrial composting, the required conditions are high
temperatures and high humidity levels. In home composting, which is carried out by private individuals, including in
communities, the actual conditions depend very much on local climate circumstances and consumer practices.
Hence, biodegradation in home composting risks being slower than in industrial composting or not to be
completed. In particular, home composting for plastic packaging should only be considered for specific applications
and in the context of specific local conditions under the supervision of the relevant authorities.
(57) Where justified and appropriate due to technological and regulatory developments impacting the disposal of
compostable plastics, and under the specific conditions ensuring that the use of such materials is beneficial for the
environmental and human health, the Commission should present, where appropriate, a legislative proposal to
amend the list of packaging that is allowed to be compostable.
(58) In order to facilitate conformity assessment as regards requirements under this Regulation on compostable
packaging, it is necessary to provide for a presumption of conformity for compostable packaging that is in line with
harmonised standards adopted under Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the
Council (27). In determining whether the presumption applies, detailed technical specifications of those requirements
should be taken into account, in line with the latest scientific and technological developments. The parameters,
including composting times and admissible levels of contamination, should reflect the actual conditions in bio-waste
treatment facilities, including anaerobic digestion processes. The current standard for industrial composting cannot
be relied upon as a basis for a presumption of conformity, as that standard needs to be revised and replaced by an
updated version. However, until such time as there is a new, or updated, harmonised standard available, the current
standard can be used as guidance. Regarding home-compostable packaging, the Commission should request the
development of EN-standardisation as appropriate.

(59) All packaging that is intended to come into contact with food or already in contact with food, including compostable
packaging, has to meet the requirements set out in Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004. Where appropriate, it should be
possible to use the documentation and information required under Union legal acts on food-contact materials as
part of the information and documentation required under this Regulation.
(60) Packaging should be designed so as to minimise its volume and weight and to enable recyclability while maintaining
its ability to perform the packaging functions. The manufacturer should assess the packaging against the
performance criteria listed in this Regulation. In view of the objectives of this Regulation to reduce packaging and
packaging waste generation, and to improve circularity of packaging across the internal market, it is appropriate to
further supplement and clarify the current criteria and to make them more stringent. The list of the packaging
performance criteria, as listed in harmonised standard EN 13428:2004 ‘Packaging – Requirements specific to
manufacturing and composition – Prevention by source reduction’, should therefore be modified. However, until
such time as a new or updated harmonised standard becomes available, the existing standard, EN 13428:2004, can
be used. While marketing and consumer acceptance remain relevant for packaging design, they should not be part of
performance criteria justifying on their own additional packaging weight and volume. However, this should not
compromise product specifications for craft and industrial products and food and agricultural products that are
registered and protected under the EU geographical indication protection scheme, as part of the Union’s objective to
protect cultural heritage and traditional know-how, including under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European
Parliament and of the Council (28) for wine, Regulation (EU) 2019/787 of the European Parliament and of the
Council (29) for spirit drinks or Regulation (EU) 2023/2411 of the European Parliament and of the Council (30) for
craft and industrial products or covered by quality schemes referred to in Regulation (EU) 2024/1143 of the
European Parliament and of the Council (31). It should also not compromise packaging designs that are protected
under Union or national law on design or trademarks or international agreements having effect in one of the
Member States. The exception of such packaging is justified only to the extent that the new rules on packaging
minimisation affect the shape of the packaging in such a way that the trademark can no longer distinguish the
trademarked good from goods of another undertaking, and the design can no longer keep its new and individual
characteristics. In order to avoid the risk of abuse, the exception should apply only to trademark and design rights
protected before 11 February 2025. On the other hand, recyclability, the use of recycled content and re-use of
packaging could justify additional packaging weight or volume and should be added to the performance criteria.
Packaging with double walls, false bottoms and other characteristics aimed only at increasing the perceived product
volume should not be placed on the market, as such packaging does not meet the requirement for packaging
minimisation. The same rule should apply to superfluous packaging not necessary for ensuring packaging
functionality.
(61) In order to comply with the packaging minimisation requirements, particular attention should be paid to limiting
the empty space in grouped and transport packaging, including e-commerce packaging.
(62) In order to facilitate conformity assessment as regards requirements under this Regulation on packaging
minimisation, it is necessary to provide for a presumption of conformity for packaging which is in conformity with
harmonised standards adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 for the purpose of expressing
detailed technical specifications of those requirements and specifying measurable design criteria, including, where
appropriate, maximum weight or empty space limits for specific packaging formats, as well as by-default,
standardised packaging designs that comply with the packaging minimisation requirements.

(63) To promote the circularity and sustainable use of packaging, reusable packaging and re-use systems should be
incentivised. For that purpose, it is necessary to clarify the notion of reusable packaging and ensure that it is linked
not only to the packaging design, but also to the setting up of re-use systems that comply with minimum
requirements as set out in this Regulation. The packaging design should enable the highest possible number of
rotations and maintain the safety, quality and hygiene requirements when being emptied, unloaded, refilled or
reloaded. In order to facilitate conformity assessment as regards requirements under this Regulation on reusable
packaging, it is necessary to provide for a presumption of conformity for packaging which is in conformity with
harmonised standards adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 for the purpose of expressing
detailed technical specifications under that Regulation and for establishing reusable packaging criteria and formats,
including minimum number of trips or rotations, standardised designs, as well as requirements for re-use systems,
including hygiene requirements.
(64) It is necessary to inform consumers and enable them to dispose of packaging waste in an appropriate manner. To
that end, it is appropriate to establish a harmonised labelling system based on the material composition of packaging
for sorting of waste and paired with corresponding labels on waste receptacles. The need for such a harmonised
labelling system to be recognised by all citizens, irrespective of their circumstances, such as age and language
knowledge, should be a guiding factor in the design of the labels. Such a system can be achieved through the use of
pictograms, with minimal use of language. Such designs would also serve to minimise translation costs, which
would otherwise be incurred.
(65) Sorting is an essential step to ensure greater circularity of packaging. The improvement of sorting capacities, in
particular through technological innovations, should be encouraged in order to enable more effective sorting, and
thus better quality feedstock for recycling.
(66) To facilitate consumers in the sorting and disposal of packaging waste, a system of harmonised symbols should be
introduced and required to be placed both on packaging and on waste receptacles, thus enabling consumers to
match the symbols for the purposes of disposal. The symbols should enable appropriate waste management as they
should provide consumers with information about the composting properties of such packaging. Such information
should, in particular, avoid consumer confusion regarding compostable packaging, which is not, as such, suitable for
home composting, but only compostable in industrially controlled conditions. Such information should therefore
prevent compostable packaging from being thrown away in nature. That approach will improve the separate
collection of packaging waste, leading to higher quality recycling of packaging waste, and is intended to introduce
a level of harmonisation of the packaging waste collection systems on the internal market. It is also necessary to
harmonise symbols associated with the mandatory deposit and return systems established after the entry into force
of this Regulation. It should be possible for Member States to require the use of such harmonised labels on packaging
subject to deposit and return systems established under national law before the entry into force of this Regulation.
Considering that transport packaging is not collected through municipal waste collection systems, the use of those
symbols should not be mandatory for transport packaging, with the exception of the e-commerce packaging.
(67) The labelling of recycled content in packaging should not be mandatory, as that information is not critical to ensure
the proper end-of-life treatment of packaging. However, manufacturers will be required to meet recycled content
targets under this Regulation and they might wish to display that information on their packaging to inform
consumers of recycled content in the packaging. To ensure that such information is communicated in a harmonised
manner across the Union, a label to indicate the recycled content should be harmonised.
(68) Labelling of biobased plastic content in packaging should also not be mandatory as there are a number of conditions
that biobased plastics have to meet to ensure sustainability and more scientific evidence is necessary to ensure that,
over their whole life-cycle, the use of biobased plastic is in line with the principles of circular economy, set out in the
communication of the Commission of 30 November 2022 on a Union policy framework on biobased,
biodegradable and compostable plastic. However, manufacturers might wish to display that information on their
packaging to inform consumers of the biobased plastic content in the packaging. To ensure that such information is
communicated in a harmonised manner across the Union, a label to indicate the biobased plastic content should be
harmonised.

(69) As regards reusable packaging, in order to inform end users about reusability, the availability of re-use systems and
the location of collection channels, such packaging should bear a QR code or other standardised, open, digital data
carrier that provides such information. The QR code or data carrier should contain information which facilitates
tracking and the calculation of trips and rotations, or an average estimation if such calculations are not feasible. That
label should be voluntary for open loop systems which do not have a system operator. In addition, reusable sales
packaging should be clearly identified at the point of sale.
(70) There should be no multiplication of labels on packaging. In order to avoid this, where other Union legal acts require
information on the packaged product to be available digitally through a data carrier, the information required under
this Regulation for the packaging and for the packaged product under the other Union legal act should be accessible
via the same data carrier. That data carrier should comply with the requirements under this Regulation or other
applicable Union law. In particular, where the packaged product is covered by Regulation (EU) 2024/1781 or other
Union law requiring a digital product passport, that digital product passport should also be used for providing the
relevant information under this Regulation. Where packaging contains substances of concern, it should be marked
using a standardised, open, digital-marking technology as established in implementing acts adopted by the
Commission. That information should ensure that waste operators have access to relevant information on the
chemical composition of the packaging to determine the most appropriate waste management option in line with
the waste hierarchy, thus promoting packaging circularity.
(71) To help achieve the objectives of this Regulation, consumers should be protected from misleading and confusing
information about the characteristics and appropriate end-of-life treatment of packaging for which harmonised
labels have been established under this Regulation. It should be possible to identify packaging included in the
extended producer responsibility scheme by a corresponding symbol throughout the territory in which that scheme
applies in order to signify that the producer fulfils its extended producer responsibility obligations. Such
identification should be achieved only by means of a QR code or other standardised, open, digital-marking
technology. That symbol should be clear and unambiguous to consumers as to the recyclability of packaging.
(72) Packaging covered by mandatory deposit and return systems should bear a label informing the consumers that the
packaging is covered by that system and that the packaging should therefore be collected through specific collection
channels that are authorised for that purpose by national authorities. That label should be a harmonised EU label
established by the Commission. It should be possible for Member States to require such harmonised labels to be used
on packaging that is subject to deposit and return systems that have been established under national law before the
entry into force of this Regulation.
(73) Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (32) works as a ‘safety net’ that ensures a high
level of consumer protection in all sectors, complementing more detailed requirements in sector-specific or
product-specific Union law, except in the case of conflict between that Directive and other Union rules related to
specific aspects of unfair commercial practices, in which case the latter should prevail in relation to those specific
aspects. Directive (EU) 2024/825 of the European Parliament and of the Council (33) provides that displaying
a voluntary sustainability label which does not meet certain requirements constitutes an unfair commercial practice.
(74) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the labelling requirements, implementing powers
should be conferred on the Commission to further improve waste sorting, to establish the methodology for
identifying the material composition of packaging and for identifying substances of concern by means of
standardised, open, digital technologies and to establish a harmonised label and specifications and format for the
labelling requirements for packaging and waste receptacles established under this Regulation. When developing
those specifications, the Commission should keep linguistic elements to a minimum and take into account scientific
or other available technical information, including relevant international standards. The existence of any variations

between Member States in the amount of the deposit charged should be taken into account in the design of the
harmonised labelling of packaging that is subject to a deposit and return system. In view of the new system,
Commission Decision 97/129/EC (34) should be repealed from 12 August 2028 and its content incorporated into the
implementing act.
(75) Economic operators should ensure that packaging complies with the requirements under this Regulation. They
should take appropriate measures to ensure such compliance in relation to their respective roles in the supply chain
in order to ensure the free movement of packaging in the internal market and to improve its sustainability.
(76) The manufacturer, having detailed knowledge of the design and production process, is best placed to carry out the
conformity assessment provided for under this Regulation. Conformity assessment under this Regulation should
therefore remain solely the obligation of the manufacturer.
(77) It should be ensured that suppliers of packaging or packaging materials provide the manufacturer with all the
information and documentation necessary for the manufacturer to demonstrate the conformity of the packaging and
the packaging materials. That information and documentation should be provided in either paper or electronic form.
(78) In order to safeguard the functioning of the internal market, it is necessary to ensure that packaging from third
countries that enters the Union market complies with this Regulation, whether imported as standalone packaging or
in association with a packaged product. In particular, it is necessary to ensure that appropriate conformity
assessment procedures have been carried out by manufacturers with regard to that packaging. Importers should
therefore ensure that the packaging they place on the market complies with those requirements and that
documentation drawn up by manufacturers is available for inspection by the competent national authorities.
(79) When placing packaging on the market, every importer should indicate on the packaging their name, registered
trade name or registered trademark as well as their postal address and, where available, electronic means of
communication through which it can be contacted. Exceptions should be provided for in cases where the packaging
does not allow for such indications.
(80) As the distributor makes packaging available on the market after it has been placed there by the manufacturer or
importer, they should act with due care in relation to the applicable requirements of this Regulation. The distributor
should also ensure that their handling of the packaging does not adversely affect its compliance with those
requirements.
(81) As distributors and importers are close to the marketplace and have an important role in ensuring packaging
compliance, they should be involved in market surveillance tasks carried out by the competent national authorities,
and should be prepared to participate actively, providing those authorities with all necessary information relating to
the packaging concerned.
(82) Any importer or distributor that either places on the market packaging under their own name or trademark or
modifies packaging already placed on the market in a way that could affect compliance with this Regulation should
be considered to be the manufacturer and should assume responsibility for the manufacturer’s obligations.
(83) Ensuring packaging’s traceability throughout the whole supply chain facilitates the market surveillance authorities’
task of tracing economic operators who placed on the market or made available on the market non-compliant
packaging. The economic operators should therefore be required to keep the information on their transactions for
a certain period of time.
(84) The problem of excessive packaging waste generation cannot be fully addressed by laying down obligations on
packaging design. For certain packaging types, obligations to reduce the empty space ratio should be imposed on
economic operators who fill or otherwise use such packaging. In the case of grouped, transport and e-commerce
packaging used for supply of products to final distributors or end users, the empty space ratio should not exceed
50 %. That obligation should not apply to reusable packaging. In line with the waste hierarchy and to promote
packaging innovation with the aim of reducing packaging waste, it should be possible for economic operators using
sales packaging as e-commerce packaging to be exempted from that obligation. In order to ensure uniform
conditions for the calculation of the empty space ratio, implementing powers should be conferred on the
Commission to establish the methodology for its calculation.

(34) Commission Decision 97/129/EC of 28 January 1997 establishing the identification system for packaging materials pursuant to
European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (OJ L 50, 20.2.1997, p. 28).
(85) In order to ensure a high level of environmental protection in the internal market as well as a high level of food
safety and food hygiene and to facilitate the achievement of the packaging waste prevention targets, unnecessary or
avoidable packaging should not be placed on the market. The list of such packaging formats is provided in this
Regulation. The Commission should publish guidelines to explain that list in more detail, including by providing
examples of the packaging and guidance on the exemptions to the restrictions.
(86) In order to further the aim of circularity and sustainable use of packaging, it is necessary to limit the risk that
packaging marketed as reusable is not re-used in practice, and to ensure that consumers return reusable packaging.
The most appropriate manner to achieve this is to oblige economic operators who use reusable packaging to ensure
that a re-use system is put in place, thus allowing such packaging to circulate, rotate and be used repeatedly. To
maximise the benefits of such systems, minimum requirements should be laid down for open loop and closed loop
systems. Confirmation of compliance of reusable packaging with a re-use system should also be a part of the
technical documentation of such packaging. Re-use systems can vary in size and geographical coverage and range
from smaller local systems to larger systems that may span over one or several Member States’ territory.
(87) Reusable packaging has to be safe for its users. Therefore, economic operators offering their products in reusable
packaging should ensure that, before a reusable packaging is used again, it is subject to a reconditioning process, for
which requirements should be laid down.
(88) Reusable packaging becomes waste, within the meaning of the Article 3, point (1), of Directive 2008/98/EC, when
its holder discards it, intends to discard it or is required to discard it. Reusable packaging in a reconditioning process
is normally not considered to be waste.
(89) To incentivise waste prevention, a new concept of ‘refill’ should be introduced. Refill should be understood as
a specific waste prevention measure that counts towards, and is necessary for, meeting the prevention targets set out
in this Regulation.
(90) Where economic operators offer the possibility to purchase products through refill, they should ensure that their
refill stations meet certain requirements in order to ensure the health and safety of consumers. In that context, where
the consumers use their own containers, the economic operators should provide information about the conditions
for the safe refill and use of those containers. In order to encourage refill, economic operators should not provide
packaging free of charge or packaging that is not part of a deposit and return system at the refill stations. Economic
operators should be exempt from liability for food safety problems that could arise from the use of containers
provided by consumers.
(91) In order to reduce the increasing proportion of packaging that is single-use and the growing quantities of packaging
waste that are generated, it is necessary to establish quantitative re-use targets on packaging in sectors which have
been assessed as having the greatest potential for packaging waste reduction, namely food and beverages for
take-away, large-white goods and transport packaging. This was appraised based on factors such as existing re-use
systems, necessity of using packaging and the possibility of fulfilling the functional requirements in terms of
containment, tidiness, health, hygiene and safety. Differences of the products and their production and distribution
systems were also taken into account. The implementation of such targets should take into account the
environmental benefits achieved throughout the whole life-cycle of a product. The setting of the targets is expected
to support innovation and increase the proportion of re-use packaging and refill solutions. Single-use plastic
packaging for food and beverages filled and consumed within the premises in the HORECA sector should not be
allowed. Consumers should always have the option to purchase food and beverages for take-away in reusable or their
own containers under conditions that are no less favourable than those applicable to food and beverages offered in
single-use packaging. Economic operators selling food or beverages for take-away should offer consumers the option
to purchase the food or beverages in their own containers and the option to purchase food and beverages in reusable
packaging.
(92) Under certain conditions, Member States should be able to exempt economic operators from re-use obligations for
a renewable period of 5 years. Those conditions should be based on high recycling and applicable waste prevention
rates in the exempting Member State, including a first intermediary waste prevention rate of 3 % by 2028, as well as
the adoption of a corporate waste prevention and recycling plan by the economic operators.
EN OJ L, 22.1.2025
16/124 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj
(93) The placing on the market of packaging that is subject to the restrictions on use of certain packaging formats under
this Regulation for means of transport operating cross-border where catering services are available on-board, such as
aircrafts, planes, trains, cruise ships, ferries, yachts and boats, should be understood as travelling with that packaging
to or within the Union. Travelling within the Union should be understood as a situation where the transport vehicle
departs from and arrives at a destination located in the Union.
(94) To increase their effectiveness and ensure the equal treatment of economic operators, the re-use targets should be
placed on the economic operators. In the case of re-use targets for beverages, the re-use targets should be placed on
final distributors that make beverages in sales packaging available to consumers. Certain beverages that are
considered perishable because they are sensitive to microbiological spoilage caused by bacteria or yeasts, need
specific aseptic technology to protect them from spoilage while keeping a long shelf life. Therefore, milk and other
perishable beverages should be exempt from the obligation to meet the packaging re-use targets. The targets should
be calculated as a percentage of sales, volume or weight sold in reusable packaging within a re-use system or, in the
case of transport packaging, as a percentage of number of times used. The targets should be material neutral. In
order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the re-use targets, implementing powers should be
conferred on the Commission as regards the methodology for their calculation.
(95) In some cases, the use of single-use transport packaging formats is not necessary, as there is a wide range of
well-functioning reusable alternatives. In order to ensure that such alternatives are used in an effective manner, it is
appropriate to require economic operators, when transporting products between different sites of the same
economic operator or between the economic operator and linked or partner enterprises, to use only reusable
transport packaging with respect to packaging formats such as pallets, foldable plastic boxes, plastic crates,
intermediate bulk containers, both rigid and flexible, or drums. The same obligation should, for the same reasons,
apply to economic operators transporting products within one Member State. For certain types of transport or sales
packaging, reusable alternatives are not an option. This is the case for cardboard boxes, where the number of
rotations is very low, and for packaging used for certain contact-sensitive products, which require special washing
between uses. Therefore, such packaging should be exempted from the obligation to meet the re-use targets for
transport packaging and sales packaging used for transporting products.
(96) Achieving re-use and refill targets can be challenging for smaller economic operators. Therefore, certain economic
operators should be exempt from the obligation to meet the packaging re-use targets if they place less than a certain
volume of packaging on the market and fulfil the definition of micro-enterprise set out in Commission
Recommendation 2003/361/EC (35) as applicable on 11 February 2025, or if a final distributor has a sales area under
a certain surface limit. For those purposes, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be
delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the sales area threshold, establishing and specifying the detailed
conditions and reporting requirements to be applied to final distributors’ pooling arrangements, amending the size
threshold for the exemption of economic operators, and establishing further exemptions for certain other economic
operators or specific packaging formats covered by the re-use or refill targets in case of particular economic
constraints, severe hygiene, food safety or environmental issues preventing the achievement of those targets.
(97) To enable the verification of compliance with the re-use targets, it is necessary that the respective economic
operators report to the competent authorities. Economic operators should report the relevant data for each calendar
year, starting from the calendar year 2030. Member States should make this data publicly available.
(98) As economic operators can have several different packaging formats, the attainment of the re-use targets should be
calculated on the basis of the total quantity of food or beverages made available on the market, by reference to the
total number of sales units, or to the weight of the food or volume of beverages, as applicable.
(99) In view of the continued high consumption levels of plastic carrier bags, inefficient use of resources and their
potential to be discarded as litter, it is appropriate to maintain provisions aimed at reaching a sustained reduction in
the consumption of plastic carrier bags, as had already been established by Directive 94/62/EC as amended by the
OJ L, 22.1.2025 EN
ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj 17/124
(35) Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized
enterprises (OJ L 124, 20.5.2003, p. 36).
Directive (EU) 2015/720 of the European Parliament and of the Council (36). In view of the current divergent
approaches and limited reporting requirements on the plastic carrier bags, it is difficult to assess whether the
consumption reduction measures taken by the Member States have achieved the objective of a ‘sustained’ reduction
in the consumption of such bags, and also if they have not increased the consumption of other types of plastic
carrier bags. It is therefore necessary to harmonise a definition of sustained reduction in the consumption of plastic
carrier bags and set a common target as well as introduce new reporting requirements.
(100) In view of the results of the 2021 evaluation study on plastic carrier bags entitled ‘Scoping study to assess the
feasibility of further EU measures on waste prevention and implementation of the Plastic Bags Directive, Part II,
Implementation of the Plastic Bags Directive’, further measures need to be taken to reduce the consumption of
lightweight plastic carrier bags and assess possible substitution effects with very lightweight plastic carrier bags and
thicker plastic carrier bags above 50 microns.
(101) As very lightweight plastic carrier bags, below 15 microns, have a high potential to become waste and contribute to
marine pollution, measures should be taken to restrict their placing on the market except for strictly necessary uses.
Those plastic bags should not be placed on the market as packaging for bulk foodstuffs, except for hygienic reasons
or for packaging wet bulk foodstuffs such as raw meat, fish or dairy products.
(102) To achieve a sustained reduction in the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags on their territory, Member
States should be able to adopt measures which include banning these types of plastic carrier bags, implementing
national reduction targets, maintaining or introducing economic instruments as well as other marketing restrictions,
provided that these measures are proportionate and non-discriminatory. Such measures may vary depending on the
environmental impact of lightweight plastic carrier bags when they are recovered or disposed of, their composting
properties, durability or specific intended use. Provided that the objectives set out in this Regulation for plastic
carrier bags are achieved, it should be possible for Member States to implement the provisions concerning those
bags by means of agreements between the competent authorities and the economic sectors concerned.
(103) A reduction in the use of plastic carrier bags should not lead to their substitution with bags from other packaging
materials. The Commission should monitor the use of other packaging materials and propose a target and, if
appropriate, measures for the reduction of the consumption of such packaging materials.
(104) In order to ensure the effective and harmonised application of sustainability requirements laid down in or pursuant
to this Regulation, compliance with those requirements should be measured using reliable, accurate and reproducible
methods that take into account generally recognised state-of-the-art methods.
(105) In order to ensure that there are no barriers to trade on the internal market, requirements on packaging
sustainability, including on substances of concern in packaging, compostable packaging, packaging minimisation,
reusable packaging and re-use systems, should be harmonised at Union level. In order to facilitate conformity
assessment as regards such requirements, including methods for tests, measurements or calculations, it is necessary
to provide for a presumption of conformity for packaging and packaged products which are in conformity with
harmonised standards that are adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 for the purpose of
expressing detailed technical specifications of those requirements.
(106) In the absence of harmonised standards, recourse to common specifications should be used as a fall-back solution to
facilitate the manufacturer’s obligation to comply with sustainability requirements, for instance where there are
undue delays in establishing a harmonised standard. In addition, recourse to common specifications should be
possible where the Commission has restricted or withdrawn the references to relevant harmonised standards in
accordance with Article 11(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. Compliance with common specifications adopted
by the Commission by means implementing acts should also give rise to a presumption of conformity.
(107) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the recourse to common specifications,
implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to lay down, amend or repeal common specifications
for the requirements on sustainability, labelling and re-use systems, and to adopt test, measurement or calculation

(36) Directive (EU) 2015/720 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2015 amending Directive 94/62/EC as regards
reducing the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags (OJ L 115, 6.5.2015, p. 11).
methods. The Commission should take into account the views of relevant bodies and expert groups and should
consult all relevant stakeholders when preparing the draft implementing acts.
(108) To ensure coherence with other Union law, the conformity assessment procedure should be the internal production
control module included in this Regulation based on the modules included in Decision No 768/2008/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council (37).
(109) CE marking on packaging should not indicate compliance of the packaging with the requirements of this Regulation,
but only indicate compliance of the packaged product with the applicable Union product law, if relevant. Indeed,
Union product law typically requires affixing the CE marking concerning the product either on the product itself or
on its packaging. Requiring CE marking on the packaging to show compliance with the requirements of this
Regulation could lead to confusion and misunderstanding in relation to the question whether the marking refers to
the packaging itself or to the packaged product and ultimately to uncertainties about the effective safety and
compliance of the packaged products concerned.
(110) Compliance of the packaging of a product with the requirements of this Regulation should be demonstrated by the
EU declaration of conformity.
(111) Manufacturers should draw up an EU declaration of conformity to provide information on the conformity of
packaging with this Regulation. It is possible that manufacturers are also required to draw up an EU declaration of
conformity under other Union law. To ensure access to information for market surveillance purposes, a single EU
declaration of conformity should be drawn up in respect of all relevant Union legal acts. To reduce the administrative
burden on economic operators, it should be possible for that single EU declaration of conformity to comprise
a dossier of relevant individual declarations of conformity.
(112) Regulation (EU) 2019/1020of the European Parliament and of the Council (38) provides a framework for the market
surveillance of products and for controls on products from third countries. That Regulation should be applicable to
packaging covered by this Regulation in order to ensure that packaging benefiting from the free movement of goods
within the Union fulfil requirements providing a high level of protection of public interests such as human health,
safety and the environment.
(113) Waste management in the Union should be improved with a view to protecting, preserving and improving the
quality of the environment, protecting human health, ensuring prudent, efficient and rational utilisation of natural
resources, promoting the principles of the circular economy, enhancing the use of renewable energy, increasing
energy efficiency, reducing the dependence of the Union on imported resources, providing new economic
opportunities and contributing to long-term competitiveness. The more efficient use of resources would also bring
substantial net savings for Union businesses, public authorities and consumers, while reducing total annual
emissions of greenhouse gases.
(114) Despite the packaging minimisation requirements and the objectives laid down in Directive 94/62/EC, packaging
waste generation has been increasing in absolute terms and on a per capita basis, and trends indicate a further steep
decline in re-use and refill of packaging amplified by increased on-the-go consumption and e-commerce. As
products, materials and consumption patterns have evolved, there has been a significant rise in the use of single-use
packaging, especially single-use plastic. This is linked to the retail landscape, with larger distribution networks,
manufacturing and packing products on high-speed packaging lines, which exert a combined downward pressure on
the market for re-use and refill.
(115) In order to monitor and verify compliance of producers and producer responsibility organisations with obligations
under extended producer responsibility relating to the collection and treatment of waste from their products, it is
necessary that Member States designate one or more competent authorities.
(116) In order to ensure a better, more timely and more uniform implementation of the waste prevention and recycling
targets by Member States and anticipate any implementation weaknesses, a system of early warning reports should
be maintained to detect shortcomings and allow taking action ahead of the deadlines for meeting the targets.

p. 1).
An extension of this system, which, under Directive 94/62/EC, covered the attainment of recycling targets, should
also include packaging waste reduction targets to be attained by Member States by 2030, 2035 and 2040.
(117) As management of packaging and packaging waste is an important element of waste management in general,
Member States should dedicate a separate chapter to that issue in their waste management plans prepared in the
execution of obligation laid down in Directive 2008/98/EC. The measures on waste prevention and re-use should be
included in the waste prevention programmes required pursuant to Directive 2008/98/EC. Those chapters should be
included in the waste management plans and the waste prevention programmes as part of their next regular
evaluation as required pursuant to Directive 2008/98/EC, or earlier.
(118) This Regulation builds on the waste management rules and general principles laid down in Directive 2008/98/EC.
(119) Waste prevention is the most efficient way to improve resource efficiency and to reduce the environmental impact of
waste. It is important therefore that economic operators take appropriate measures to reduce the generation of waste
by eliminating excessive packaging and the use of certain packaging formats, by extending the life span of packaging,
by re-designing products or sales strategies so that no or less packaging can be used, including bulk sales, and by
shifting from single-use packaging to reusable packaging.
(120) To achieve an ambitious and sustained reduction in the overall generation of packaging waste, the waste prevention
targets should be set for the reduction of packaging waste per capita to be achieved by 2030. Meeting a target of 5 %
reduction of packaging waste by 2030 compared to 2018 should entail an overall absolute reduction of
approximately 19 % on average across the Union in 2030 compared to the 2030 baseline scenario. In order to
ensure that the reduction efforts continue beyond 2030, a reduction target of 10 % compared to 2018 should be set
for 2035; this is estimated to reduce packaging waste by 29 % compared to the 2035 baseline scenario. An
additional reduction target of 15 % compared to 2018 should also be set for 2040; this is estimated to reduce
packaging waste by 37 % compared to the 2040 baseline scenario. In order to support Member States in achieving
the packaging waste prevention targets, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to establish
a correction factor to account for the increase or decrease in tourism in relation to the base year 2018. As the
generation of commercial and industrial packaging waste is not related to household consumption, the waste
prevention targets per capita cannot apply as such to commercial and industrial packaging waste. Member States
which have established a different system for the management of household packaging waste, on one hand, and of
industrial and commercial packaging waste, on the other, should be able to retain their specificity.
(121) It should be possible for Member States to achieve the waste prevention targets by economic instruments and other
measures to provide incentives for the application of the waste hierarchy, including measures to be implemented
through extended producer responsibility schemes, by promoting the setting up and effective operation of re-use
systems and by encouraging economic operators to offer end users further possibilities to refill. Such measures
should be adopted in parallel and in addition to other measures under this Regulation that aim to reduce packaging
and packaging waste, such as requirements on packaging minimisation, re-use targets and refill obligations, volume
thresholds and measures to achieve the sustained reduction in the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags. It
should be possible for Member States, while observing the general rules laid down in the TFEU and acting in
accordance with this Regulation, to adopt provisions which go beyond the minimum waste prevention targets set
out in this Regulation. When implementing such measures, Member States should be aware of the risk of a shift
from heavier to lighter packaging materials and should prioritise measures that minimise that risk.
(122) To implement the polluter pays principle, which is expressed in Article 191(2) TFEU, it is appropriate to lay the
obligations for the management of packaging waste on producers. To that end, this Regulation builds on the
extended producer responsibility requirements laid down in Directive 2008/98/EC in order to ensure that the
extended producer responsibility scheme covers the full waste management costs of packaging and to facilitate
adequate controls by the competent authorities. This Regulation seeks to clearly define one producer per packaging
unit, whether it is for empty packaging or for packaging containing products. As a general rule, the producer should
be the economic operator who, as a manufacturer, importer or distributor established in a Member State, makes
available packaged products from within the territory of that Member State and on that same territory. This includes
EN OJ L, 22.1.2025
20/124 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj
any offer for distribution, consumption or use which could result in actual supply. Thus, where a company buys
a packaged product from another Member State other than that where the company is located, or from a third
country, and supplies that packaged product in the Member State where it is located, that company should be
considered to be the producer, as it is the first company making the packaged product available on the territory of
that Member State. With regard to online platforms, the initial offering of a product should be considered as being
made available in the sense of the producer definition. However, to minimise any unnecessary administrative burden
for small businesses that fill transport packaging, primary production packaging or service packaging, whether as
a single-use packaging or as reusable packaging, at the point of sale, the producer should be the manufacturer,
distributor or importer of such packaging that makes the packaging available for the first time from within the
territory of the Member State, since that economic operator is best placed to comply with the extended producer
responsibility obligations.
(123) On the other hand, when the packaging or the packaged product is made available by means of distance contracts
directly to the end user, the producer could also be established in another Member State or in a third country. In such
cases, if the producer is established in another Member State, it should appoint an authorised representative for the
extended producer responsibility in the Member State where the end user is located. In cases where the producer is
established in a third country, it should also be possible for Member States to provide that the appointment of an
authorised representative for the extended producer responsibility be mandatory in order to avoid the risk of eluding
the extended producer responsibility obligations. In order to ensure respect for the polluter pays principle, and in the
context of compliance with extended producer responsibility, it is necessary to ensure certainty as to which kind of
producer is responsible for packaging waste, in particular in the case of ‘logistics companies’. Logistics companies are
companies that receive imported goods from third countries and that conduct handling activities regarding the
imported goods (e.g. unpacking and repacking into smaller formats or quantities to comply with clients’ requests)
before sending the goods to clients, whether in the same or another Member State, with all, part of or without the
original transport packaging. In such cases, a producer should be identified for the original transport packaging that
comes from a third country, remains with the logistics company and becomes waste in the Union. Typically, the
logistics company will not have ownership of the goods, but should be considered as the producer for packaging
that comes from a third country and that it handles during its activity.
(124) In addition to the costs imposed on producers pursuant to this Regulation and pursuant to Directive 2008/98/EC,
Member States retain the possibility to cover the necessary costs resulting from cleaning activities, including
transport and subsequent treatment of packaging waste present in litter, as a part of the full waste management cost
of packaging which should be covered by the extended producer responsibility. Those costs should not exceed the
costs that are necessary to provide those services in a cost-efficient way and should be established in a transparent
and non-discriminatory way between the actors concerned.
(125) In order to monitor that producers meet their financial and organisational obligations to ensuring the management
of the waste from the packaging they make available on the territory of a Member State for the first time, or unpack
packaged products without being end users, it is necessary that a register of producers be established and managed
by the competent authority in each Member State and that producers be obliged to register.
(126) The producer registration requirements should be harmonised across the Union to the greatest extent possible to
facilitate registration, in particular given that producers make packaging available in different Member States. In
order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the registration requirements, implementing powers
should be conferred on the Commission to establish the format for registration in, and reporting to, the register and
specifying the granularity of data to be provided and the packaging types and material categories to be covered by
the information submitted.
(127) In line with the polluter pays principle, it is essential that the producers, including e-commerce actors, that place
packaging and packaged products on the Union market, or unpack packaged products without being end users, take
responsibility for the management of that packaging and those packaged products at their end-of-life. Extended
producer responsibility schemes are to be established, as provided for in Directive 94/62/EC, by 31 December 2024,
as they are the most appropriate means to achieve this and can have a positive environmental impact by reducing
the generation of packaging waste and increasing the collection and recycling of packaging waste. There are wide
disparities in the way extended producer responsibility schemes are set up, in their efficiency and in the scope of
responsibility of producers. The rules on extended producer responsibility laid down in Directive 2008/98/EC
should therefore, in general, apply to extended producer responsibility schemes for producers under this Regulation,
and be complemented by further specific provisions where this is necessary and appropriate. For example, in order
to facilitate the separate collection of packaging waste, the producers should finance the labelling of waste
OJ L, 22.1.2025 EN
ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj 21/124
receptacles. Such an obligation would be in line with the polluter pays principle and the general minimum
requirements for extended producer responsibility schemes established under Directive 2008/98/EC.
(128) As regards the extended producer responsibility obligations, this Regulation is a lex specialis in relation to Directive
2008/98/EC. That means that the provisions related to the extended producer responsibility in this Regulation
should prevail over any conflicting provisions in that Directive. This principle concerns, for example, requirements
on producer registration, modulation of extended producer responsibility fees and reporting.
(129) In addition to the harmonised requirement on recyclability for the modulation of the producers’ financial
contributions to be laid down in delegated acts adopted in accordance with this Regulation, Member States should be
allowed to use other criteria, such as recycled content, reusability, presence of hazardous substances or other criteria
in accordance with Directive 2008/98/EC.
(130) Producers should be able to fulfil obligations related to the extended producer responsibility collectively, by means of
producer responsibility organisations taking up the responsibility on their behalf. Producers or producer
responsibility organisations should be subject to authorisation by the Member States and should document, amongst
other things, that they have the financial means to cover the costs entailed by the extended producer responsibility.
When laying down administrative and procedural rules of authorisation of producers for individual and producer
responsibility organisations for collective compliance, it should be possible for Member States to differentiate
processes for individual producers and producer responsibility organisations to limit the administrative burden on
individual producers. Member States can authorise multiple producer responsibility organisations, as competition
among them may lead to greater consumer benefits. The competent authority should be able to charge cost-based
and proportionate fees to producers or producer responsibility organisations entrusted with the fulfilment of the
extended producer responsibility obligations for the authorisation procedure concerning the fulfilment of those
obligations.
(131) In cases where the extended producer responsibility fee charged by a producer responsibility organisation is
categorised as public revenue, as in the case of a state-run producer responsibility organisation, and in order to
follow the budgetary rules that require the public revenue to be based on accurate data, it should be possible for the
Member State to require more frequent submission of the information for reporting to the competent authority
responsible for the register by the producer than once a year. Since state-run producer responsibility organisations
do not have a represented producer’s mandate, the requirements provided in this Regulation concerning such
mandates should not apply.
(132) This Regulation should specify how the traceability of traders’ obligations laid down in Regulation (EU) 2022/2065
of the European Parliament and of the Council (39), including Article 30(2) and (3) thereof, are to be applied to
providers of online platforms allowing consumers to conclude distance contracts with producers offering packaging
to consumers located in the Union in relation to the registers of producers established pursuant to this Regulation.
For the purposes of this Regulation, any producer, whether established in a Member State or a third country, that
offers packaging by means of distance contracts directly to consumers located in a Member State should be
considered to fall within the definition of trader under Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. In order to prevent free-riding
from the extended producer responsibility obligations, it should be specified how the providers of online platforms
should fulfil those obligations with regard to the registers of packaging producers established pursuant to this
Regulation. In that context, where providers of online platforms that fall within the scope of Section 4 of Chapter III
of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 enable consumers to conclude distance contracts with producers, they should, in
accordance with Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 and prior to allowing producers to use their services, obtain
information from those producers about their compliance with the extended producer responsibility obligations set
out in this Regulation. The rules on traceability of traders selling packaging online are subject to the enforcement
rules set out in Regulation (EU) 2022/2065.
(133) Similar undesirable situations of free-riding could occur in relation to fulfilment service providers. This Regulation
aims to prevent such free-riding by means of an approach similar to that of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 as regards
providers of online platforms.
EN OJ L, 22.1.2025
22/124 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj
(39) Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on a Single Market For Digital
Services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (Digital Services Act) (OJ L 277, 27.10.2022, p. 1).
(134) The register of producers established pursuant to this Regulation is to be considered a public register for the
purposes of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. Therefore, providers of online platforms allowing consumers to conclude
distance contracts with producers should make their best efforts to assess whether the information provided by the
producers concerned is reliable and complete, in particular by using or verifying freely available official online
databases and online interfaces or by requesting the traders concerned to provide trustworthy supporting
documents, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. As far as publicly available data in the register of
producers is concerned, ‘making best efforts’ within the meaning of Article 30(2), first subparagraph, of Regulation
(EU) 2022/2065 usually requires the verification of the information provided by the producer with the publicly
available data in the register of producers. In particular, this applies if a Member States has established an online
interface for automated data reconciliation in accordance with this Regulation.
(135) Financial contributions imposed on producers pursuant to this Regulation in addition to the costs referred to in
Article 8a(4), point (a), of Directive 2008/98/EC should be without prejudice to any voluntary agreement between
online marketplaces and producers, where online marketplaces, on behalf of producers by written mandate, consent
to accept all or part of those costs.
(136) Member States should provide for measures implementing the extended producer responsibility, rules on separate
collection of packaging waste and rules on the labelling of waste receptacles where this Regulation does not provide
for full harmonisation of those measures and rules. Furthermore, it should be possible for Member States to provide
for additional requirements for the implementation of the extended producer responsibility, in accordance with
Directive 2008/98/EC and this Regulation, provided that such measures do not create barriers on the internal
market. This Regulation does not regulate which operator is responsible for the collection of packaging waste and
other national contractual arrangements for packaging waste collection.
(137) Member States should set up return and collection systems for packaging waste, so that packaging waste is
channelled to the most appropriate waste management alternative, in line with the waste hierarchy. The systems
should be open for the participation of all interested parties, in particular for economic operators and public
authorities. The systems should be established taking into account the environment and consumer health, safety and
hygiene. Return and collection systems should also be accessible and applicable for the packaging of imported
products under non-discriminatory provisions.
(138) Some Member States could have already established separate waste collection and recycling systems which are the
basis for relevant national authorisations and contractual arrangements, when transposing Article 7 of Directive
94/62/EC in national law. It should be possible for those Member States to continue to use those systems, provided
that they correctly implement the obligations under this Regulation.
(139) Member States should also take measures promoting recycling which meets the quality standards for the use of the
recycled materials in relevant sectors. That obligation is particularly relevant in view of the minimum percentage set
for recycled content in plastic packaging.
(140) The collection of packaging is a crucial step to ensure its circularity and to ensure a strong market for secondary raw
materials. The establishment of a mandatory collection rate is an incentive to develop efficient and targeted
collection systems at national level and is intended to increase the quantity of waste sorted and potentially recycled.
(141) It has been shown that well-functioning deposit and return systems ensure a very high collection rate and
high-quality recycling, especially of beverage bottles and cans. In order to support the achievement of the separate
collection target for single-use plastic beverage bottles laid down in Directive (EU) 2019/904, to drive up collection
rates further and to achieve higher-quality recycling of metal beverages containers, it is appropriate that Member
States establish deposit and return systems. Those systems will contribute to increasing the supply of good quality
secondary raw material suitable for closed loop recycling and reduce beverage container litter.
(142) Deposit and return systems should be obligatory for single-use plastic beverage bottles and metal beverage
containers. Member States can also decide to include other packaging for other products or made of other materials
in those systems, in particular single-use glass bottles. Member States should ensure that deposit and return systems
for single-use packaging formats, in particular for single-use glass beverage bottles, are equally available for reusable
packaging, where technically and economically feasible. They should consider establishing deposit and return
systems also for reusable packaging. Member States should be allowed, while observing the general rules laid down
in the TFEU and acting in accordance with this Regulation, to adopt provisions which go beyond the minimum
requirements set out in this Regulation, such as charging a deposit at the point of sale in the case of consumption in
OJ L, 22.1.2025 EN
ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj 23/124
hospitality premises or the obligation for all final distributors to accept the deposit-bearing packaging regardless of
the packaging material and format that they distribute or their sale surface area.
(143) This Regulation should take into account the diversity of deposit and return systems that exist in the Union and
ensure that technological developments in those systems are not hindered as long as they meet the requirements and
criteria for increasing collection rates and ensuring better-quality recycling.
(144) Given the nature of the products and the differences in their production and distribution systems, deposit and return
systems should however not be obligatory for packaging for wine, aromatised wine products and similar products to
wine, spirit drinks and milk and milk products listed in Part XVI of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.
However, Member States may establish deposit and return systems covering such beverage packaging and also other
beverage and non-beverage packaging.
(145) By 1 January 2029, all deposit and return systems for single-use plastic beverage bottles and single-use metal
beverage containers should comply with the general minimum requirements laid down in this Regulation, with the
exception of deposit and return systems established before the entry into force of this Regulation which achieve the
90 % separate collection target by 1 January 2029. Those requirements will help deliver greater consistency and
higher return rates across Member States. They have been set based on stakeholder views, expert analysis and best
practices from the existing deposit and return systems. The requirements are designed to allow for innovation while
offering a level of flexibility to adapt to local circumstances.
(146) Member States with regions with high transboundary business should ensure that the deposit and return systems
allow for collection of packaging from deposit and return systems of the Member States concerned at designated
collection points and should endeavour to enable the possibility of returning the deposit.
(147) It should be possible for Member States which achieve an 80 % collection rate of the targeted packaging types
without a deposit and return system in 2026 to request not to establish a deposit and return system.
(148) It should be possible for Member States to choose to implement the deposit and return system at subnational level,
taking into account relevant national administrative divisions and the specific situation of overseas territories, as
long as they demonstrate the environmental and economic performance of such a scheme and that it is fully
consistent with the 90 % collection rate for single-use plastic beverage bottles and metal beverage containers set out
in this Regulation.
(149) As a specific packaging waste generation prevention measure, Member States should actively encourage re-use and
refill solutions. They should support the establishment of re-use and refill systems and monitor their functioning and
compliance with hygiene standards. Member States are encouraged to also take other measures, such as setting up
deposit and return systems covering reusable packaging formats, using economic incentives or establishing
requirements for final distributors to make a certain percentage of other products available than those covered by
re-use targets and refill obligations in reusable packaging or through refill provided that such requirements will not
result in fragmentation of single market and creation of trade barriers.
(150) Requirements for collection, sorting, redistribution to fillers and cleaning are of a completely different nature for
single-use deposit and return systems and for deposit-based re-use systems. Therefore, the minimum requirements
for deposit and return systems should not apply to deposit-based re-use systems. Instead, specific requirements
should apply to re-use systems.
(151) Directive 94/62/EC was amended by Directive (EU) 2018/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council (40)
setting out recycling targets for Member States to be achieved by 2025 and 2030. Those targets and the rules for
their calculation should be retained. While recognising the different starting point of each Member State in relation
to recycling targets and while measures facilitating the attainment of those targets are proposed in this Regulation, it
should still be possible to postpone the deadlines for attaining the 2030 recycling targets, under certain conditions.
However, the Commission should be empowered to reject a revised implementation plan submitted by a Member
State.
EN OJ L, 22.1.2025
24/124 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj
(40) Directive (EU) 2018/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 amending Directive 94/62/EC on
packaging and packaging waste (OJ L 150, 14.6.2018, p. 141).
(152) Directive 94/62/EC requires the Commission to review the 2030 recycling targets for packaging with the view to
maintaining or, if appropriate, increasing them. However, it is not yet appropriate to amend the targets set for 2030,
as evidence shows that some Member States still have difficulties to meet the existing targets. For that reason,
measures encouraging manufacturers to place on the market more recyclable packaging, and thereby helping
Member States to achieve the recycling targets, should be set up. In the future, more granular data on packaging and
packaging waste recycling flows should be reported to the Commission. The reporting of that data will enable the
Commission to review the targets with the possibility of maintaining or increasing them. In order to take account of
the effect of the measures aimed at improving the packaging recyclability, the review should not take place earlier
than the envisaged general evaluation of this Regulation, that is 7 years after its entry into force. During that review,
attention should also be paid to the possibility of introducing new targets on a more granular basis than the current
targets.
(153) The calculation of the recycling targets should be based on the weight of packaging waste which enters recycling.
Member States should ensure the reliability and accuracy of the data gathered on recycled packaging waste. As
a general rule, the actual measurement of the weight of packaging waste to be counted as recycled should be at the
point where packaging waste enters the recycling operation. Nevertheless, in order to limit the administrative
burden, Member States should, under strict conditions and by way of derogation from the general rule, be allowed to
establish the weight of packaging waste recycled on the basis of measuring the output of any sorting operation, to be
corrected by taking into account average loss rates occurring before the waste enters the recycling operations. Losses
of materials which occur before the waste enters the recycling operation, for instance due to sorting or other
preliminary operations, should not be included in the quantities of waste reported as recycled. Those losses can be
established on the basis of electronic registries, technical specifications, detailed rules on the calculation of average
loss rates for various waste streams or other equivalent measures. Member States should include information on
such measures in the quality check reports accompanying the data which they submit to the Commission on waste
recycling. The average loss rates should preferably be established at the level of individual sorting facilities and
should be linked to the main different types of waste, different sources (such as household or commercial), different
collection schemes and different types of sorting processes. Average loss rates should only be used in cases where no
other reliable data are available, in particular in the context of shipment and export of waste. Losses in weight of
materials or substances due to physical or chemical transformation processes inherent in the recycling operation
where packaging waste is actually reprocessed into products, materials or substances should not be deducted from
the weight of the waste reported as recycled.
(154) Where the calculation of the recycling rate is applied to aerobic or anaerobic treatment of biodegradable packaging
waste, the quantity of waste that enters aerobic or anaerobic treatment can be counted as recycled, provided that
such treatment generates output which is to be used as a recycled product, material or substance. While the output
of such treatment is most commonly compost or digestate, other output could also be taken into account provided
that it contains comparable quantities of recycled content in relation to the quantity of the treated biodegradable
packaging waste. In other cases, in line with the definition of recycling, the reprocessing of biodegradable packaging
waste into materials which are to be used as fuels or other means to generate energy, which are disposed of, or which
are to be used in any operation that has the same purpose as recovery of waste other than recycling should not be
counted towards the attainment of the recycling targets.
(155) Where packaging waste materials cease to be waste as a result of a preparatory operation before being actually
reprocessed, they should be counted as recycled provided that they are destined for subsequent reprocessing into
products, materials or substances, whether for their original or other purposes. End-of-waste materials which are to
be used as fuels or other means to generate energy, which are backfilled or disposed of, or which are to be used in
any operation that has the same purpose as recovery of waste other than recycling should not be counted towards
the attainment of the recycling targets.
(156) When establishing the methodology for the calculation and verification of the percentage of recycled content, the
Commission should assess the available recycling technologies, taking into account their economic and
environmental performance, including the quality of the output, the availability of the waste, the energy needed
and the emissions of greenhouse gases and other relevant environmental impacts. The Commission should also take
into account the potential of such technologies to be used for misleading environmental claims.
(157) Claims on packaging characteristics for which legal requirements are set out in this Regulation, such as recyclability,
the level of recycled content and reusability, should only be made in relation to packaging properties exceeding the
applicable minimum requirements set out in this Regulation and in accordance with the methodologies and rules
OJ L, 22.1.2025 EN
ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj 25/124
established under this Regulation. Such claims should also specify whether they relate to the packaging unit, part of
the packaging unit or to all packaging placed on the market by the economic operator.
(158) Member States should have the right to take into account the recycling of metals separated after incineration of
waste in proportion to the share of the packaging waste incinerated, provided that the recycled metals meet certain
quality criteria laid down in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1004 (41).
(159) In the case of exports of packaging waste from the Union for recycling, Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the
European Parliament and of the Council (42) and Regulation (EU) 2024/1157 of the European Parliament and of the
Council (43) apply.
(160) As re-use means that no new packaging is placed on the market, reusable sales packaging that is placed on the
market and wooden packaging that is repaired for re-use should be taken into account for the purposes of attaining
the respective packaging recycling targets. Member States should be able to use that possibility to calculate adjusted
level of recycling targets by taking into account maximum 5 percentage points of the average share, in the preceding
three years, of reusable sales packaging placed on the market for the first time and reused within a re-use system.
(161) Producers and producer responsibility organisations should be actively involved in providing information to end
users, in particular consumers, on prevention and management of packaging waste. That information should include
availability of re-use arrangements for packaging, meaning of labels displayed on packaging and other instructions
on the discarding of packaging waste. Producers and producer responsibility organisations should also inform
consumers that packaging marked as compostable means that the packaging is compostable in industrially
controlled conditions in bio-waste treatment facilities and is not suitable for home composting. Packaging should
not be discarded as litter. The producers should also inform that end users have an important role in ensuring an
environmentally optimal management of packaging waste. The disclosure of information to all end users as well as
reporting on packaging should make use of modern information technologies. The information should be provided
either by classical means, such as posters, both indoors and outdoors, and social media campaigns, or by more
innovative means, such as electronic access to websites provided by QR codes affixed to the packaging.
(162) Separate out-of-home collection is an important element to increase collection rates of packaging and improve its
circularity. Member States and economic actors should be able to take specific measures for separate out-of-home
collection, adapted to the location and habits of consumers.
(163) For each calendar year, Member States should provide the Commission with information on attainment of recycling
targets. To evaluate the effectiveness of the measures aiming to reduce the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier
bags, data on consumption of very lightweight plastic carrier bags, lightweight plastic carrier bags, thick plastic
carrier bags and of very thick plastic carrier bags should also be reported to allow for the assessment whether the
consumption of these bags has increased in response to the reduction measures targeting lightweight plastic carrier
bags. In order to allow for the assessment of whether the mandatory deposit and return systems to be set up by the
Member States are effective, or whether exemptions by Member States from the obligation to set up those systems
are justified, it is important to obtain information, through Member States reporting, on the separate collection rate
of packaging covered by the obligation to establish deposit and return system.
(164) In order to establish the methodology on the recycled-at-scale assessment, Member States should also report, on an
annual basis, data on the quantity of recycled packaging waste per packaging category and the quantity of packaging
made available for the first time on the territory of the Member State, or unpacked by a producer who is not an end
user, per packaging category. The Commission should aggregate those data and publish them to monitor the annual
evolution of the recycled-at-scale packaging waste.

ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1157/oj).
(165) Member States should report data to the Commission electronically and provide it with a quality check report. In
addition, data on recycling targets should be accompanied by a report which describes the measures undertaken to
establish an effective system of quality control and traceability of packaging waste.
(166) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the reporting obligations, implementing powers
should be conferred on the Commission to establish rules for calculation and verification of data on attainment of
the recycling targets, separate collection rates of packaging covered by the deposit and return system, and data
necessary for establishing the methodology for the recycled-at-scale assessment. That implementing act should also
include methodology for determining the quantity of packaging waste generated as well as lay down the format for
the submission of data. It should also establish the methodology for the calculation of the annual consumption of
lightweight plastic carrier bags per capita and the format for the submission of those data, as those data are
necessary to support the monitoring and full implementation of the substantive requirements related to plastic
carrier bags, in particular to ensure disaggregated and mandatory data on different categories of plastic carrier bags.
That implementing act should replace Commission Decision 2005/270/EC (44) and Commission Implementing
Decision (EU) 2018/896 (45).
(167) In order to contribute to enabling Member States and the Commission to monitor the implementation of the
objectives set out in this Regulation, the Member States should establish packaging databases and ensure that those
databases function well.
(168) Effective enforcement of sustainability requirements is essential to ensure fair competition and to ensure that this
Regulation’s expected benefits and contribution to achieving the Union’s climate, energy and circularity objectives
are achieved. Therefore, competent authorities should endeavour to carry out checks on the accuracy of at least part
of the EU declarations of conformity each year. Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 setting out a horizontal framework for
market surveillance and control of products entering the Union market should apply to packaging for which
sustainability requirements are set pursuant to this Regulation. The market surveillance mechanisms laid down in
Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 sets out the requirements for market surveillance relating to the marketing of products
and provides for safeguard mechanisms to check compliance with this Regulation in respect of placing packaging on
the market.
(169) Packaging should be placed on the market only if it does not present a known risk to the environment and human
health. In order to focus market surveillance efforts, packaging presenting a risk should, for the purposes of this
Regulation, be defined as packaging that, by not complying with a sustainability requirement or because
a responsible economic operator does not comply with a sustainability requirement, could adversely affect the
environment or other public interests protected by the relevant requirements.
(170) A procedure should exist under which interested parties are informed of measures intended to be taken with regard
to packaging presenting a risk. It should also allow market surveillance authorities in the Member States, in
cooperation with the relevant economic operators, to act at an early stage with regard to such packaging. In order to
ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on
the Commission to determine whether national measures in respect of non-compliant products are justified. The
Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to the
protection of the environment or human health, imperative grounds of urgency so require.
(171) The market surveillance authorities should have the right to require economic operators to take corrective action on
the basis of findings either that packaging is not compliant with sustainability and labelling requirements or that the
economic operator has infringed other rules on the placing or making available on the market of packaging. In order
to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the requirement on economic operators to take corrective
action, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to decide whether a national measure is
justified.

(45) Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/896 of 19 June 2018 laying down the methodology for the calculation of the
annual consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags and amending Decision 2005/270/EC (OJ L 160, 25.6.2018, p. 6).
(172) In case of human health concerns, the market surveillance authority should not evaluate a risk to human or animal
health originating from the packaging material, if transferred to the packaged content of the packaging material, but
should alert the authorities competent to carry out controls on that risk and appointed pursuant to Regulation (EU)
2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council (46), Regulations (EU) 2017/745, (EU) 2017/746, (EU)
2019/6 or Directive 2001/83/EC.
(173) Public procurement amounts to 14 % of the Union’s GDP. In order to contribute to the objectives of reaching climate
neutrality, improving energy and resource efficiency and transitioning to a circular economy that protects public
health and biodiversity, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to require, where
appropriate, contracting authorities and entities as defined in Directives 2014/24/EU (47) and 2014/25/EU (48) of the
European Parliament and of the Council, to align their public procurement with specific minimum mandatory green
public procurement requirements, to be set out in the implementing acts adopted pursuant to this Regulation.
Compared to a voluntary approach, mandatory requirements should maximise the leverage of public spending to
boost demand for better performing packaging. The requirements should be transparent, objective and
non-discriminatory. It should be possible for Member States to refer to technical specifications, selection criteria
or contract performance conditions in their public procurement requirements and it should not be necessary for
those requirements to be cumulative. Contracting authorities and entities should be able, while observing the general
rules laid down in the TFEU and acting in accordance with this Regulation, to adopt provisions which go beyond the
minimum green public procurement requirements laid down in this Regulation.
(174) In order to safeguard the functioning of the internal market and create a level playing field, it is necessary to ensure
that packaging from third countries entering the Union market complies with this Regulation, whether it is imported
as standalone packaging or in association with a packaged product. In particular, it is necessary to ensure that
appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been carried out by manufacturers with regard to that
packaging. Priority should be given to cooperation in the market between market surveillance authorities and
economic operators. Therefore, whereas they may concern any packaging entering the Union market, interventions
by authorities designated pursuant to Article 25(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 should focus primarily on
packaging subject to prohibition measures taken by market surveillance authorities. Where they take such
prohibition measures, and the prohibition measures are not restricted to the national territory, market surveillance
authorities should communicate to authorities designated for the controls on packaging entering the Union market
the details necessary for the identification of such non-compliant packaging at the borders, including information on
the packaged products and the economic operators, to enable a risk-based approach for products entering the Union
market. In such cases, customs will aim at identifying and stopping this packaging at the borders.
(175) In order to optimise and unburden the control process at the external borders of the Union, it is necessary to allow
for an automated data transfer between the Information and Communication System on Market Surveillance
(ICSMS) and customs systems. Two different data transfers should be distinguished in view of their respective
purposes. First, prohibition measures decided by market surveillance authorities further to the identification of
non-compliant packaging should be communicated from the ICSMS to customs for use by authorities designated for
the purpose of carrying out controls at external borders to identify packaging to which such prohibition measure
should apply. The electronic Customs Risk Management System set out in Article 36 of Commission Implementing
Regulation (EU) 2015/2447 (49), without prejudice to any future evolution of the customs risk management

(OJ L 343, 29.12.2015, p. 558).
environment, should be used for those first data transfers. Secondly, where customs authorities identify
non-compliant packaging, case management will be necessary to, among others, transfer the notification of the
suspension, the conclusion of market surveillance authorities and the outcome of the actions taken by customs. The
EU Single Window Environment for Customs supports those second data transfers between the ICSMS and national
customs systems.
(176) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the interconnection for communication between
the market surveillance authorities and the customs authorities, implementing powers should be conferred on the
Commission to specify the procedural rules and the details of the implementation arrangements, including the
functionalities, data elements and data processing, as well as the rules on the processing of personal data,
confidentiality and controllership for that interconnection.
(177) When adopting delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU, it is of particular importance that the Commission
carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those
consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of
13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (50). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated
acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and
their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of
delegated acts. When developing these delegated acts, the Commission should take into account scientific or other
available technical information, including relevant international standards.
(178) The implementing powers that are conferred on the Commission by this Regulation should be exercised in
accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (51).
(179) In order to ensure that product requirements in Directive (EU) 2019/904 can be monitored and enforced, and that
they are subject to appropriate market surveillance, Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 should be amended to include
Directive (EU) 2019/904 into its scope. Provisions concerning requirements related to the recycled plastic content
for plastic beverage bottles as of 1 January 2030 and corresponding reporting obligations should be deleted from
Directive (EU) 2019/904, as this matter is exclusively regulated by this Regulation.
(180) This Regulation establishes general rules that apply to all packaging. However, certain single-use plastic products
covered by Directive (EU) 2019/904, such as plastic carrier bags, beverage cups, food and beverage containers,
including bottles, are considered to be packaging. Directive (EU) 2019/904 is a lex specialis in relation to this
Regulation. In the event of a conflict between Directive (EU) 2019/904 and this Regulation, Directive (EU) 2019/904
should prevail within the scope of its application. Directive (EU) 2019/904 requires Member States to take measures
to reduce the consumption of certain single-use plastic products, including marketing restrictions. Such marketing
restrictions should apply and prevail over any conflicting provisions in this Regulation. This Regulation provides
a restriction on the placing on the market of plastic products listed in Annex V point 3 thereto, while Directive (EU)
2019/904 allows the Member States to take the necessary measures to achieve reduction in the consumption of
those single-use plastic products. Since national implementing measures under Directive (EU) 2019/904 can be less
restrictive than a ban on the placing on the market, this Regulation should prevail over Directive (EU) 2019/904 as
regards such products falling within the definition of packaging, in order to boost the reduction of single-use plastic
packaging and reduce the quantity of single-use plastic packaging in the environment. As a consequence, it should
not be possible for Member States to adopt an exemption from the ban in Directive (EU) 2019/904 on placing
packaging made of expanded polystyrene on the market. To reflect this, Directive (EU) 2019/904 should be
amended accordingly.
(181) As this Regulation does not regulate the recycled content in any plastic part of packaging before 1 January 2030,
provisions regarding requirements for recycled content for plastic beverage bottles in Directive (EU) 2019/904
should remain in force until that date.
(182) To enhance public trust in packaging placed on the market, in particular as regards compliance with sustainability
requirements, the economic operators who place non-compliant packaging on the market or who do not comply
with their obligations should be subject to penalties. It is therefore necessary that Member States lay down effective,
proportionate and dissuasive penalties in national law for failure to comply with this Regulation.

(51) Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and
general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers (OJ
L 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13).
(183) Article 19(1) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) requires Member States to provide remedies that are sufficient
to ensure effective judicial protection in the fields covered by Union law, including the courts of the Member States.
In that respect, Member States should ensure that persons concerned, such as natural or legal persons having
complained about or having reported an alleged non-compliance of packaging, whether as standalone packaging or
in association with a packaged product, with this Regulation, have access to justice in line with the obligations that
Member States have agreed to as parties to the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in
Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (52), done in Aarhus on 25 June 1998 (the ‘Aarhus
Convention’).
(184) The Commission should carry out an evaluation of this Regulation. Pursuant to paragraph 22 of the
Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making, that evaluation should be based on the
five criteria of efficiency, effectiveness, relevance, coherence and Union value added and should provide the basis for
impact assessments of possible further measures. The Commission should submit to the European Parliament, to the
Council, the European Economic and Social Committee, and to the Committee of the Regions a report on the
implementation of this Regulation and its impact on the environmental sustainability of packaging and the
functioning of the internal market.
(185) It is necessary to provide for sufficient time for economic operators to adapt their operations in order to fulfil their
obligations and comply with the requirements of this Regulation. Similarly, it is necessary to provide for sufficient
time for Member States to adopt administrative measures regarding the organisation of the authorisation procedures
by the competent authorities, while maintaining continuity for economic operators, and to set up the administrative
infrastructure necessary for application of this Regulation. The application of this Regulation should therefore be
deferred to a date by which those preparations can reasonably be finalised. Particular attention should be paid to
facilitate compliance by micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with their obligations and requirements
under this Regulation, including through guidance to be provided by the Commission to facilitate compliance by
economic operators, with a focus on SMEs.
(186) In order to meet those commitments and establish an ambitious yet harmonised framework on packaging, it is
necessary to adopt a Regulation establishing requirements on packaging over its entire life-cycle. Directive 94/62/EC
should therefore be repealed.
(187) Directive 94/62/EC should be repealed with effect from the date of application of this Regulation. However, in order
to ensure a smooth transition and continuity until new rules are adopted by the Commission under this Regulation,
and to provide for continuity in the application of the system of own resources of the Union with regard to the own
resource based on non-recycled plastic packaging waste, certain obligations under that Directive related to labelling,
recycling targets and the transmission of data to the Commission should remain in force for a certain period of time.
(188) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to improve the environmental sustainability of packaging and to
ensure the free movement of packaging in the internal market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States
but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in
accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of
proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve
those objectives,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
CHAPTER I
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Article 1
Subject matter
1. This Regulation establishes requirements for the entire life-cycle of packaging as regards environmental sustainability
and labelling, to allow its placing on the market. It also establishes requirements for extended producer responsibility,
EN OJ L, 22.1.2025
30/124 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj
(52) OJ L 124, 17.5.2005, p. 4.
packaging waste prevention, such as the reduction of unnecessary packaging and the re-use or refill of packaging, as well as
the collection and treatment, including recycling, of packaging waste.
2. This Regulation contributes to the efficient functioning of the internal market by harmonising national measures on
packaging and packaging waste in order to avoid obstacles to trade and the distortion and restriction of competition within
the Union, while preventing or reducing the adverse impacts of packaging and packaging waste on the environment and
human health, on the basis of a high level of environmental protection.
3. This Regulation contributes to the transition to a circular economy and to achieving climate neutrality at the latest by
2050, as provided for under Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council (53), by laying down
measures in line with the waste hierarchy set out in Article 4 of Directive 2008/98/EC (‘waste hierarchy’).
Article 2
Scope
1. This Regulation applies to all packaging, regardless of the material used, and to all packaging waste, whether such
packaging is used in or such packaging waste originates from industry, other manufacturing, retail or distribution, offices,
services or households.
2. This Regulation applies without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 2008/98/EC as regards the management of
hazardous waste as well as to Union regulatory requirements for packaging such as those for safety, quality, the protection
of health and the hygiene of packed products, and to transport requirements. However, where this Regulation conflicts with
Directive 2008/68/EC, Directive 2008/68/EC shall prevail.

CHAPTER II
SUSTAINABILITY REQUIREMENTS
Article 5
Requirements for substances in packaging
1. Packaging placed on the market shall be so manufactured that the presence and concentration of substances of
concern as constituents of the packaging material or of any of the packaging components is minimised, including with
regard to their presence in emissions and any outcomes of waste management, such as secondary raw materials, ashes or
other material for final disposal, and to the adverse impact on the environment due to microplastics.
2. The Commission shall monitor the presence of substances of concern in packaging and packaging components and
shall take, where appropriate, the relevant follow-up measures.
By 31 December 2026, the Commission, assisted by the European Chemicals Agency, shall prepare a report on the presence
of substances of concern in packaging and packaging components, to determine the extent to which they negatively affect
the re-use and recycling of materials or impact chemical safety. That report may list the substances of concern present in
packaging and packaging components and indicate the extent to which they could present an unacceptable risk to human
health and the environment.
The Commission shall submit the report to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the committee referred to in
Article 65 of this Regulation setting out its findings and shall consider appropriate follow-up measures, including:
(a) for substances of concern in packaging materials which primarily affect human health or the environment, the use of
the procedures referred to in Article 68(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 to adopt new restrictions;
(b) for substances of concern that negatively affect the re-use and recycling of materials in the packaging in which they are
present, the establishment of restrictions as a part of design for recycling criteria in accordance with Article 6(4) of this
Regulation.
If a Member State considers that a substance negatively affects the re-use and recycling of materials in the packaging in
which it is present, it shall, by 31 December 2025, supply such information to the Commission and the European
Chemicals Agency and, where available, refer to the relevant risk assessments or other relevant data.
3. Member States may request the Commission to consider restricting, pursuant to Article 6(4), point (a), the use of
substances of concern that potentially negatively affect the re-use and recycling of materials in packaging in which they are
present, for reasons other than those related primarily to the chemical safety of those substances. Member States shall
accompany such requests with a report documenting the identity and uses of the substances and a description of how the
use of the substances in packaging hinders recycling, for reasons other than those related primarily to chemical safety. The
Commission shall evaluate the request and present the results of that evaluation to the committee referred to in Article 65.
4. Without prejudice to the restrictions on chemicals set out in Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 or, where
applicable, to the restrictions and specific measures on food-contact materials and articles in Regulation (EC)
No 1935/2004, the sum of the concentrations of lead, cadmium, mercury and hexavalent chromium resulting from
substances present in packaging or packaging components shall not exceed 100 mg/kg.
5. From 12 August 2026, food-contact packaging shall not be placed on the market if it contains per- and
polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) in a concentration equal to or above the following limit values to the extent that the
placing on the market of packaging containing such a concentration of PFAS is not prohibited pursuant to another Union
legal act:
(a) 25 ppb for any PFAS as measured with targeted PFAS analysis (polymeric PFAS excluded from quantification);
(b) 250 ppb for the sum of PFAS measured as the sum of targeted PFAS analysis, where applicable with prior degradation
of precursors (polymeric PFAS excluded from quantification); and
EN OJ L, 22.1.2025
38/124 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj
(c) 50 ppm for PFASs (including polymeric PFAS); if total fluorine exceeds 50 mg/kg the manufacturer, importer or
downstream user as defined respectively in Article 3, points (9), (11) and (13) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 shall,
upon request, provide to the manufacturer or the importer as defined respectively in Article 3(1), points (13) and (17),
of this Regulation proof of the quantity of fluorine measured as content of either PFAS or non-PFAS in order for them
to draw up the technical documentation as referred to in Annex VII to this Regulation.
‘PFAS’ means any substance that contains at least one fully fluorinated methyl (CF3-) or methylene (-CF2-) carbon atom
(without any H/Cl/Br/I attached to it), except substances that only contain the following structural elements: CF3-X or
X-CF2-X′, where X = -OR or -NRR′ and X′ = methyl (-CH3), methylene (-CH2-), an aromatic group, a carbonyl group (-C
(O)-), -OR′′, -SR′′ or –NR′′R′′′; and where R/R′/R′′/R′′′ is a hydrogen (-H), methyl (-CH3), methylene (-CH2-), an aromatic
group or a carbonyl group (-C(O)-).
By 12 August 2030, the Commission shall carry out an evaluation to assess the need to amend or repeal this paragraph in
order to avoid overlaps with restrictions or prohibitions on the use of PFAS laid down in accordance with Regulations (EC)
No 1935/2004, (EC) No 1907/2006, or (EU) 2019/1021.
6. Compliance with the requirements set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article shall be demonstrated in the technical
documentation drawn up in accordance with Annex VII.
7. In order to take account of scientific and technical progress, the Commission may adopt delegated acts in accordance
with Article 64 to amend this Regulation in order to lower the sum of the concentrations of lead, cadmium, mercury and
hexavalent chromium resulting from substances present in packaging or packaging components referred to in paragraph 4
of this Article.
8. In order to take account of scientific and technical progress, the Commission may adopt delegated acts in accordance
with Article 64 to supplement this Regulation in order to determine the conditions under which the sum of the
concentrations referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article shall not apply to recycled materials or to product loops which are
in a closed and controlled chain, as well as to determine the packaging types or formats of packaging, based on the
packaging categories listed in Table 1 of Annex II to this Regulation, which shall be exempted from the requirements laid
down in that paragraph. Such delegated acts shall be justified on the basis of a case by case analysis, time-limited, provide
for appropriate marking and information requirements, and contain requirements for regular reporting in order to ensure
that the exemption is regularly reviewed. Delegated acts adopted in accordance with this paragraph shall only be adopted to
amend derogations established in Decisions 2001/171/EC and 2009/292/EC.
9. By 12 August 2033, the Commission shall carry out an evaluation to assess whether this Article and the design for
recycling criteria set out in accordance with Article 6(4) have contributed sufficiently to minimising the presence and
concentration of substances of concern as constituents of packaging materials.
Article 6
Recyclable packaging
1. All packaging placed on the market shall be recyclable.
2. Packaging shall be considered to be recyclable if it fulfils the following conditions:

quality when compared to the original material that they can be used to substitute primary raw materials, in accordance
with paragraph 4; and
(b) when it becomes waste, it can be collected separately in accordance with Article 48(1) and (5), sorted into specific waste
streams without affecting the recyclability of other waste streams and recycled at scale, on the basis of the methodology
set out in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article.
Packaging that is in compliance with the delegated acts adopted pursuant to paragraph 4 shall be deemed to comply with
the condition set out in point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph.
Packaging that is in compliance with the delegated acts adopted pursuant to paragraph 4 and the implementing acts
adopted pursuant to paragraph 5 shall be deemed to comply with the conditions set out in the first subparagraph of this

(b) as appropriate, amend the list of the exceptions in paragraph 4 of this Article.
13. Where the lack of availability or excessive prices of specific recycled plastics makes compliance with the minimum
percentages of recycled content set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article excessively difficult, the Commission shall be
empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 64 to amend those paragraphs by adjusting the minimum
percentages accordingly. In evaluating whether such adjustment is appropriate, the Commission shall assess requests from
natural or legal persons to be accompanied by relevant information and data on the market situation for the post-consumer
plastic waste and best available evidence regarding the related risks to human or animal health, to the security of food
supply or to the environment. The Commission shall adopt such a delegated act only in exceptional cases where there
would be severe adverse effects for human or animal health, the security of food supply or the environment.
14. By 12 February 2032, taking into account the evolution of the state of the art of the technology and the practical
experience gained by economic operators and Member States, the Commission shall present a report reviewing the
implementation of the 2030 minimum percentages of recycled content set out in paragraph 1 and evaluating to what extent
those percentages lead to solutions fostering sustainable packaging that are effective and easy to implement, the feasibility
of the achievement of the 2040 minimum percentages on the basis of the experience in achieving the 2030 minimum
percentages and the evolving circumstances, the relevance of maintaining the exceptions and derogations set out in this
Article, and the necessity or pertinence of setting new minimum percentages of recycled content. That report shall, where
appropriate, be accompanied by a legislative proposal amending this Article, in particular the 2040 minimum percentages
of recycled content.
15. By 12 February 2032, the Commission shall review the situation regarding the use of recycled packaging materials
in packaging other than plastics and, on that basis, assess the appropriateness of establishing measures, or setting targets,

CHAPTER V
OBLIGATIONS OF ECONOMIC OPERATORS TO REDUCE PACKAGING AND PACKAGING WASTE
Article 24
Obligation related to excessive packaging
1. By 1 January 2030 or 3 years from the entry into force of the implementing acts adopted pursuant to paragraph 2,
whichever is the latest, economic operators who fill grouped packaging, transport packaging or e-commerce packaging
shall ensure that the maximum empty space ratio, expressed as a percentage, is 50 %.
2. By 12 February 2028, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts to establish the methodology for the
calculation of the empty space ratio referred to in paragraph 1. That methodology shall take into account the special
characteristics of packaging which needs to be placed in an empty space that is large enough to comply with applicable legal
requirements or to protect the product, such as, in particular, packaged products of irregular shape, packaging containing
more than one sales packaging or product, packaging containing liquid products, packaged products the content of which
can easily be damaged and packaged products that can be damaged by larger products due to their small dimensions, and
the minimum space on the transport packaging to enable shipment labels to be affixed.
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 65(2).
3. For the purpose of the calculation of the ratio referred to in paragraph 1:
(a) empty space shall mean the difference between the total volume of grouped packaging, transport packaging or
e-commerce packaging and the volume of sales packaging contained therein;
(b) empty space ratio shall mean the ratio of the empty space as defined in point (a) and the total volume of the grouped
packaging, transport packaging or e-commerce packaging.
Space filled by filling materials, such as paper cuttings, air cushions, bubble wraps, sponge fillers, foam fillers, wood wool,
polystyrene or Styrofoam chips, shall be considered as empty space.
4. By 12 February 2028, the economic operators who fill sales packaging shall ensure that empty space is reduced to the
minimum necessary for ensuring the packaging functionality, including product protection. The empty space ratio for sales
packaging shall mean the difference between the total internal volume of the sales packaging and the volume of the
packaged product.
For the purpose of assessing compliance with this paragraph, space filled by filling materials, such as paper cuttings, air
cushions, bubble wraps, sponge fillers, foam fillers, wood wool, polystyrene or Styrofoam chips, shall be considered as
empty space.
For sales packaging for products that are subject to settlement during transportation or where headspace is required to
protect the food product, or other products that present these characteristics:
(a) compliance with this paragraph shall be assessed as the pack-fill level at the time of filling;
(b) air between or within packed foodstuff or protective gases shall not be considered as empty space.
5. Economic operators using sales packaging as e-commerce packaging or using reusable packaging within a system of
re-use shall be exempt from the obligation laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article. They shall nevertheless ensure that such
sales packaging complies with the requirements set out in Article 10.
EN OJ L, 22.1.2025
56/124 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj
6. By 12 February 2032, the Commission shall review the empty space ratio referred to in paragraph 1 as well as the
exemptions in paragraph 5, and assess the possibility of establishing empty space ratios for sales packaging, particularly for
toys, cosmetics, do-it-yourself kits and electronic products.
Article 25
Restrictions on use of certain packaging formats
1. From 1 January 2030, economic operators shall not place on the market packaging in the formats and for the uses
listed in Annex V.
2. By way of derogation from Article 4(2), Member States may maintain restrictions adopted before 1 January 2025 on
the placing on the market of packaging in the formats and for the uses listed in Annex V but made from materials not listed
in Annex V.
3. Paragraph 1 of this Article shall be without prejudice to Article 9(2), point (b).
4. By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, Member States may allow micro-enterprises as defined in
Recommendation 2003/361/EC as applicable on 11 February 2025 to place on the market packaging in the formats and
for the uses listed in point 3 of Annex V to this Regulation where it has been demonstrated that it is not technically feasible
not to use such packaging or to obtain access to infrastructure that is necessary for the functioning of a re-use system.
5. By 12 February 2032, the Commission shall assess the positive environmental impact of the restrictions and
derogations and exemptions from these restrictions, and shall take into account the availability of alternative packaging
solutions that meet safety and hygiene requirements applicable to contact-sensitive packaging. On the basis of that
assessment, the Commission shall, with the objective of reducing packaging waste, review this Article and Annex V to adapt
them to technical and scientific progress. On the basis of that review, the Commission shall assess the appropriateness of
establishing new restrictions on the use of specific packaging formats and the relevance of maintaining the derogations and
exemptions set out in this Article, and, where appropriate, shall present a legislative proposal.
6. By 12 February 2027, the Commission shall publish guidelines, in consultation with Member States and the European
Food Safety Authority, which explain Annex V in more detail, including examples of the packaging formats in scope, and
any exemptions from the restrictions, and provide a non-exhaustive list of fruits and vegetables that are excluded from
point 2 of Annex V.

ensure that a system is in place in that Member State for the re-use of that packaging which includes an incentive to ensure
the collection of that packaging and which meets the requirements laid down in Annex VI. Those economic operators shall
be considered to comply with this paragraph where they make use of existing re-use systems that are already in place in the
Member States.
2. The description of the system’s compliance with requirements pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article shall be drawn
up as part of the technical documentation on reusable packaging to be provided pursuant to Article 11(3). For that
purpose, the manufacturer shall request the relevant written confirmations from system participants set out in Annex VI.
Article 27
Obligation related to re-use systems

accordance with Part B of Annex VI prior to offering it again for use by end users.
OJ L, 22.1.2025 EN
ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj 57/124
3. Economic operators that make use of reusable packaging may appoint a third party to be responsible for one or more
mutualised re-use systems.
Where economic operators have appointed a third party as referred to in the first subparagraph, the obligations set out in
this Article shall be met by that third party on their behalf.
4. Economic operators that make use of reusable packaging in closed loop systems in accordance with the requirements
in Annex VI shall be required to return the packaging to one or more of the collection points identified by the system
participants and approved by the system operator.
Article 28

containers are offered to the end users at refill stations, that packaging and those containers are not provided free of charge
if they do not meet the requirements laid down in Annex VI or are provided as a part of a deposit and return system.
4. Economic operators may refuse to refill a container provided by the end user if the end user does not comply with the
rules for refill communicated by the economic operator pursuant to paragraph 1, in particular if the economic operators
consider the container to be unhygienic or unsuitable for the sale of food or drink. Economic operators shall bear no
liability for hygiene or food safety issues that arise from the use of containers provided by the end user.
5. From 1 January 2030, final distributors with a sales area of more than 400 m2 shall endeavour to dedicate 10 % of
that sales area to refill stations for both food and non-food products.

OJ L, 22.1.2025 EN
ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj 67/124
(c) 15 % by 2040.
2. In order to support Member States achieve the packaging waste prevention targets set out in paragraph 1 of this
Article, by 12 February 2027, the Commission shall establish a correction factor to account for the increase or decrease in
tourism in relation to the base year 2018 by means of implementing acts adopted pursuant to Article 56(7), point (c). That
correction factor shall be based on the rate of packaging waste generation per tourist and the variation in the number of
tourists relative to the base year 2018 and take the packaging waste reduction potential in tourism into account.
3. Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 and 4, Member States that have already established separate systems for the
management of household packaging waste, on the one hand, and for industrial and commercial packaging waste, on the
other, may retain those systems.

packaging waste generated.
5. In addition to the measures provided for by this Regulation, Member States shall, in line with the overall objectives of
the Union’s waste policy and in order to reach the targets set out in this Article, implement measures that aim to prevent
the generation of packaging waste and to minimise the environmental impact of packaging. Such measures may include the
use of economic instruments and other measures to provide incentives for the application of the waste hierarchy, such as
the measures referred to in Annexes IV and IVa to Directive 2008/98/EC, or other appropriate instruments and measures,
including incentives provided through extended producer responsibility schemes, and obligations on producers or producer
responsibility organisations to adopt waste prevention plans. The measures shall be proportionate and non-discriminatory
and be designed so as to avoid barriers to trade or distortions of competition. Such measures shall not lead to a shift to
lighter packaging material being used to fulfil the goal of packaging waste reduction.
6. For the purpose of paragraph 5 of this Article and without prejudice to Article 16(2) of Directive (EU) 2020/2184 of
the European Parliament and of the Council (73), Member States shall incentivise restaurants, canteens, bars, cafés and

minimum targets set out in paragraph 1, while acting in accordance with this Regulation.
8. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Member States may, by 31 December 2025, request the Commission to use
a base year other than 2018 for the calculations of the targets set out in paragraph 1. If a Member State makes such request,
the Commission may, without prejudice to paragraphs 5 and 7, allow the Member State to use such other base year for the
purpose of calculating the targets set out in paragraph 1 on condition that the Member State provide substantiated
evidence:
(a) of a significant increase in packaging waste during the year that it requests to use as a base year for the purpose of
calculating the targets set out in paragraph 1;
(b) that the significant increase in packaging waste demonstrated under point (a) is due to changes in the reporting
procedures only;
(c) that the significant increase in packaging waste demonstrated under point (a) is not due to an increased consumption;
and
(d) of better comparability of data between the Member States.
9. By 12 February 2032, the Commission shall review the targets laid down in paragraph 1 and assess the need to
include specific targets for certain packaging materials. To that end, the Commission shall submit a report to the European
Parliament and to the Council, accompanied, if the Commission finds it appropriate, by a legislative proposal.

Article 48
Return and collection systems
1. Member States shall ensure that systems and infrastructures are set up to provide for the return and separate
collection of all packaging waste from the end users, in order to ensure that it is treated in accordance with Articles 4, 10
and 13 of Directive 2008/98/EC, and to facilitate its preparation for re-use and high-quality recycling.
Packaging that complies with design for recycling criteria as established in delegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 6(4) of
this Regulation shall be collected for recycling. Incineration and landfill of such packaging shall be prohibited, with the
exception of waste resulting from subsequent treatment operations of separately collected packaging waste for which
recycling is not feasible or does not deliver the best environmental outcome.
2. In order to facilitate high-quality recycling, Member States shall ensure that systems and infrastructures for
comprehensive collection and sorting are in place to facilitate recycling and to ensure that plastic feedstock is available for
recycling. Such systems and infrastructures may provide priority access to recycled materials for use in applications where
the distinct quality of the recycled material is preserved or recovered in such a way that it can be recycled further and used
in the same way and for a similar application with minimal loss of quantity, quality or function.
3. Member States may derogate from the return and separate waste collection obligation in paragraph 1 of this Article
for certain formats of waste, provided that collecting fractions of packaging waste together, or collecting packaging waste or
fractions of such packaging waste together with other waste does not affect the capacity of such packaging or fractions of
packaging waste to undergo preparing for re-use, recycling or other recovery operations in accordance with Articles 4 and
13 of Directive 2008/98/EC and generates output from those operations which is of comparable quality to that achieved
through separate collection.
4. Member States may ensure that packaging waste that is not collected separately is sorted prior to disposal or energy
recovery operations to remove packaging designed for recycling.
5. The systems and infrastructures referred to in paragraph 1 shall:
(a) be open to the participation of the economic operators of the sectors concerned, the competent public authorities and
third parties carrying out waste management on their behalf;
(b) cover the whole territory of the Member State and all packaging waste from all types of packaging and activities, and
take into account population size, expected volume and composition of packaging waste, as well as accessibility and
proximity to end users; they shall include the separate collection in public spaces, business premises and residential
areas, and shall be of sufficient capacity;
(c) be open to imported products under non-discriminatory conditions, in particular with regard to the detailed
arrangements and any tariffs imposed for access, and be designed so as to avoid barriers to trade or distortions of
competition.
6. Member States may provide for public waste management systems to participate in the organisation of the systems
referred to in paragraph 1.

(c) as a result of the derogation from the targets in the period of postponement, the recycling rate for a single target set out
in paragraph 1, points (b)(v) and (vi), is not reduced below 60 %, and the recycling rate for a single target set out in
paragraph 1, points (d)(v) and (vi), is not reduced below 70 %; and
(d) at the latest 24 months before the respective deadline laid down in paragraph 1, points (b) and (d), of this Article, the
Member State notifies the Commission of its intention to postpone the deadline and submits to the Commission an
implementation plan in accordance with Annex XI to this Regulation, which may be combined with an implementation
plan submitted pursuant to Article 11(3), point (b), of Directive 2008/98/EC.
3. Where a Member State requests to postpone the deadline laid down in paragraph 1, point (d), of this Article the
Commission may, within 3 months of receipt of the implementation plan submitted pursuant to paragraph 2, point (d), of
this Article request the Member State to revise the plan if the Commission considers that the plan does not comply with the
requirements set out in Annex XI. The Member State shall submit a revised implementation plan within 3 months of receipt
of the Commission’s request. If the Commission considers that the revised implementation plan does not comply with the
requirements set out in Annex XI and that it is unlikely that the Member State will be able to meet the targets within the
period of postponement pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article, the Commission shall reject the implementation plan and
the Member State shall be obliged to comply with the targets within the deadlines set in paragraph 1, point (d), of this
Article.
4. By 12 February 2032, the Commission shall review the targets laid down in paragraph 1, points (c) and (d), with
a view to increasing them or setting further targets. To that end, the Commission shall submit a report to the European
Parliament and to the Council, accompanied, if the Commission finds it appropriate, by a legislative proposal.
5. Member States shall, where appropriate, encourage the use of materials obtained from recycled packaging waste for
the manufacturing of packaging and other products by:
(a) improving market conditions for such materials;
(b) reviewing existing rules that prevent the use of such materials.
6. A Member State may, while observing the general rules laid down in the TFEU and acting in accordance with this
Regulation, adopt provisions which go beyond the minimum targets set out in this Article.
Article 53
Rules on the calculation of the achievement of the recycling targets
1. The calculation to determine whether the targets laid down in Article 52(1) have been achieved shall be carried out in
accordance with the rules laid down in this Article.
2. Member States shall calculate the weight of packaging waste generated in a given calendar year. The calculation of
packaging waste generated in a Member State shall be exhaustive.
The methodology to calculate the packaging waste generated shall be based on the following approaches:
(a) the packaging made available on the territory of a Member State, or unpacked by a producer without being an end user,
in that specific year; or
(b) the quantity of packaging waste generated in the same year in that Member State.
Calculations performed pursuant to this paragraph shall be adjusted to ensure the comparability, reliability and
exhaustiveness of the results in accordance with the requirements and verifications to be established by the implementing
act adopted pursuant to Article 56(7), point (a).
3. Member States shall calculate the weight of packaging waste recycled in a given calendar year. The weight of
packaging waste recycled shall be calculated as the weight of packaging that has become waste which, having undergone all
necessary checking, sorting and other preliminary operations to remove waste materials that are not targeted by the
EN OJ L, 22.1.2025
78/124 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj
subsequent reprocessing and to ensure high-quality recycling, enters the recycling operation whereby waste materials are
actually reprocessed into products, materials or substances.
4. Composite packaging and other packaging composed of more than one material shall be calculated and reported per
material contained in the packaging. Member States may derogate from this requirement where a given material constitutes
an insignificant part of the packaging unit, and in no case more than 5 % of the total mass of the packaging unit.
5. For the purposes of paragraph 3, the weight of packaging waste recycled shall be measured when the waste enters the
recycling operation.
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the weight of the packaging waste recycled may be
measured at the output of any sorting operation provided that:
(a) such output waste is subsequently recycled;
(b) the weight of materials or substances that are removed by further operations preceding the recycling operation and are
not subsequently recycled is not included in the weight of waste reported as recycled.
6. Member States shall establish an effective system of quality control and traceability of the packaging waste to ensure
that the conditions laid down in paragraphs 2 to 5 of this Article are met. That system may consist of electronic registries
set up pursuant to Article 35(4) of Directive 2008/98/EC or technical specifications for the quality requirements of sorted
waste. It may also consist of average loss rates for sorted waste for various waste types and waste management practices,
respectively, provided that reliable data cannot be otherwise obtained. Average loss rates shall be calculated on the basis of
the calculation rules established in the delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 11a(10) of Directive 2008/98/EC.
7. The quantity of biodegradable packaging waste that enters aerobic or anaerobic treatment may be counted as recycled
where that treatment generates compost, digestate, or other output with a similar quantity of recycled content in relation to
input, which is to be used as a recycled product, material or substance. Where the output is used on land, Member States
may count it as recycled provided that this use results in benefits to agriculture or ecological improvement.
8. The quantity of packaging waste materials that have ceased to be waste as a result of a preparatory operation before
being reprocessed may be counted as recycled provided that such materials are destined for subsequent reprocessing into
products, materials or substances to be used for the original or other purposes. However, end-of-waste materials to be used
as fuels or other means to generate energy, or to be incinerated, backfilled or landfilled, shall not be counted as recycled.
9. Member States may take into account the recycling of metals separated after incineration of waste in proportion to the
share of the packaging waste incinerated provided that the recycled metals meet the quality criteria laid down in Decision
(EU) 2019/1004.
10. Where packaging waste is sent to another Member State for the purposes of recycling in that other Member State,
only the Member State in which that packaging waste was collected may count it as recycled.
11. Packaging waste exported from the Union shall be counted as recycled by the Member State in which it was collected
only if the requirements set out in paragraph 3 are met and if, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 or
Regulation (EU) 2024/1157, as applicable, the exporter provides documentary evidence that the shipment of waste
complies with the requirements of that Regulation, including that the treatment of packaging waste in a third country took
place under conditions that are equivalent to the requirements of the relevant Union environmental law.
Article 54
Rules on the calculation of the achievement of the recycling targets by including re-use
1. A Member State may decide to achieve an adjusted level of the targets set out in Article 52(1) for a given year by
taking into account the average share, in the preceding 3 years, of reusable sales packaging placed on the market for the first
time and re-used within a re-use system.
OJ L, 22.1.2025 EN
ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj 79/124
The adjusted level shall be calculated by subtracting:
(a) from the targets laid down in Article 52(1), points (a) and (c), the share of the reusable sales packaging referred to in the
first subparagraph of this paragraph in all sales packaging placed on the market; and
(b) from the targets laid down in Article 52(1), points (b) and (d), the share of the reusable sales packaging referred to in the
first subparagraph of this paragraph, composed of the respective packaging material, in all sales packaging composed of
that material placed on the market.
No more than five percentage points of the average share of reusable sales packaging shall be taken into account for the
calculation of the adjusted target level.
2. A Member State may take into account the quantity of wooden packaging that is repaired for re-use in the calculation
of the targets laid down in Article 52(1), point (a), Article 52(1), point (b)(ii), Article 52(1), point (c), and Article 52(1),
point (d)(ii).

CHAPTER IX
SAFEGUARD PROCEDURES
Article 58
Procedure for dealing with packaging presenting a risk at national level
1. Without prejudice to Article 19 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, where the market surveillance authorities of
a Member State have sufficient reason to believe that packaging covered by this Regulation presents a risk to the
environment or human health, they shall, without undue delay, carry out an evaluation in relation to the packaging
concerned covering all requirements laid down in this Regulation that are relevant to that risk. The relevant economic
operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authorities.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the authorities responsible for the enforcement of this Regulation shall follow
up on complaints or reports related to alleged non-compliance of packaging with this Regulation, and verify that the
appropriate corrective action has been taken.
Where, in the course of the evaluation carried out pursuant to the first subparagraph, the market surveillance authorities
find that the packaging does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation, they shall, without delay,
require the relevant economic operator to take appropriate and proportionate corrective measures, within a period
prescribed by the market surveillance authorities which is reasonable and commensurate with the nature and, where
relevant, the degree of the non-compliance, to bring the packaging into compliance with those requirements.
EN OJ L, 22.1.2025
82/124 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj
2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, where there is a risk to human health relating to contact-sensitive packaging
that is subject to a specific law aimed at protecting human health and that risk is transferred to the packaged content of the
packaging material, the market surveillance authorities shall not carry out an evaluation in relation to the risk to human or
animal health originating from the packaging material. Instead, they shall alert the authorities competent for evaluating
such risks, namely the competent authorities referred to in Regulations (EU) 2017/625, (EU) 2017/745, (EU) 2017/746 or
(EU) 2019/6 or Directive 2001/83/EC.
3. Where the market surveillance authorities consider that non-compliance is not restricted to their territory, they shall
inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which they have
required the economic operator to take.
4. The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective measures are taken in respect of all the
non-compliant packaging that the economic operator has made available on the market throughout the Union.
5. Where the economic operator does not take adequate corrective measures within the period referred to in
paragraph 1, third subparagraph, or the non-compliance persists, the market surveillance authorities shall take all
appropriate provisional measures to prohibit the making available of the packaging on their territory, to withdraw it or to
recall it.
The market surveillance authorities shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of those measures without
delay.
6. The information to be sent to the Commission and the other Member States pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article
shall be communicated through the information and communication system referred to in Article 34 of Regulation (EU)
2019/1020 and shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant
packaging, the origin of the packaging, the nature of the alleged non-compliance and the risk involved, the nature and
duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put forward by the economic operator and, where applicable,
the information referred to in Article 61(1) of this Regulation. The market surveillance authorities shall also indicate
whether the non-compliance is due to either of the following:
(a) failure of the packaging to meet the sustainability requirements laid down in or pursuant to this Regulation;
(b) shortcomings in the harmonised standards or common specifications referred to in Articles 36 and 37 of this
Regulation.
7. Member States other than the Member State taking the measures pursuant to paragraph 5 shall, without delay, inform
the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal
relating to the non-compliance of the packaging concerned, and, in the event that Member States object to the measures
taken pursuant to paragraph 5, of their objections.
8. Where, within 3months of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 5 or 7 no objection has been raised
either by a Member State or the Commission in respect of provisional measures taken by a Member State, those measures
shall be considered justified.
Member States may provide for a longer or shorter period of application for provisional measures than 3months in order to
take account of the specificities of the requirements concerned.
9. Member States shall ensure that the packaging is withdrawn from their market or that other appropriate restrictive
measures are taken without delay in respect of the packaging or the manufacturer concerned.
Article 59
Union safeguard procedure
1. Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 58(5) and (6), objections are raised against a measure taken
by a Member State pursuant to Article 58, or where the Commission considers a national measure to be contrary to Union
law, the Commission shall, without delay, enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic
operator and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall adopt
an implementing act determining whether the national measure is justified.
That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 65(2).
OJ L, 22.1.2025 EN
ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj 83/124
2. The Commission shall address the implementing act referred to in paragraph 1 to all Member States and shall
communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator without delay.
If the national measure is considered justified, all Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the
non-compliant packaging is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly.
If the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw that measure.
3. Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the packaging is attributed to
shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in Article 36 of this Regulation, the Commission shall apply the
procedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.
4. Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the packaging is attributed to
shortcomings in the common technical specifications referred to in Article 37, the Commission shall, without delay, amend
or repeal the common technical specifications concerned.
Article 60
Compliant packaging which presents a risk
1. Where, having carried out an evaluation under Article 58, a Member State finds that although packaging is in
compliance with the applicable requirements laid down in or pursuant to Articles 5 to 12, it nevertheless presents a risk to
the environment or human health, it shall, without delay, require the relevant economic operator to:
(a) take all appropriate measures, within a reasonable period prescribed by the market surveillance authorities and
commensurate with the nature and, where relevant, the degree of risk, to ensure that the packaging concerned, when
placed on the market, no longer presents that risk;
(b) bring the packaging into conformity;
(c) withdraw the packaging from the market; or
(d) recall the packaging.
2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, where there is a risk to human health relating to contact-sensitive packaging
that is subject to a specific law aimed at protecting human health and that risk is transferred to the packaged content of the
packaging material, the surveillance authorities shall not carry out an evaluation in relation to the risk to human or animal
health originating from the packaging material. Instead, they shall alert the authorities competent for controlling such risks,
namely the competent authorities referred to in Regulations (EU) 2017/625, (EU) 2017/745, (EU) 2017/746 or (EU)
2019/6 or Directive 2001/83/EC.
3. The economic operator shall ensure that corrective measures are taken in respect of all the non-compliant packaging
that the economic operator has made available on the market throughout the Union.
4. The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States of its findings and
subsequent actions pursuant to paragraph 1. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data
necessary for the identification of the non-compliant packaging, the origin and the supply chain of the packaging, the
nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration of the national measures taken.
5. The Commission shall, without delay, enter into consultation with the Member State and the relevant economic
operator and shall evaluate the national measures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall
adopt an implementing act determining whether the national measure is justified and, where necessary, propose
appropriate measures.
That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 65(2).
On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency relating to the protection of the environment or human health, the
Commission shall adopt an immediately applicable implementing act in accordance with the procedure referred to in
Article 65(3).
The Commission shall address the implementing act referred to in this paragraph to all Member States and shall
immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator.

Table 3
Recyclability performance grades
Packaging recyclability shall be expressed in the performance grades A, B or C.
From 2030, recyclability performance is based on design for recycling criteria. The design for recycling criteria shall ensure
the circularity of the use of the resulting secondary raw materials of sufficient quality to substitute the primary raw
materials.
The assessment based on design for recycling criteria shall be carried out for each packaging category listed in Table 1,
taking into account the methodology established under Article 6(4) and the related delegated acts, as well as the parameters
established in Table 4. After weighing the criteria per packaging unit, it will be classified into categories A, B or C. When
a packaging unit’s recyclability performance grade is below 70 %, it is considered to be non-compliant with the recyclability
performance grades and therefore the packaging will be considered technically non-recyclable and its placing on the market
shall be restricted.
From 2035, a new factor shall be added to the assessment of the packaging recyclability, which is the recycled-at-scale
assessment. Consequently, a new assessment shall be carried out based on the quantity (weight) of the material effectively
recycled from each of the packaging categories in accordance with the methodology established in the implementing acts
adopted under Article 6(5). The thresholds related to the annual recycled packaging materials for compliance with the
recycled-at-scale assessment shall be defined taking into account the targets set in Article 3(1), point (39).

Table 4
Non-exhaustive list of parameters for setting design for recycling criteria under Article 6
The list in this Table shall be used as a basis when defining design for recycling criteria, as set out in Article 6(4). The design
for recycling criteria shall then be used in order to set the calculations leading to the performance grades listed in Table 3. In
addition, the assessment of the parameters set out in that list shall consider:
— separability of any component of packaging, either manually by end users or in processing plants,
— efficiency of sorting and recycling processes, for example yield,
— evolution of sorting and recycling technologies (to address the aspect if the packaging cannot be sorted today, but it
might be sortable in 2 years), and
— preservation of functionality of secondary raw materials enabling the substitution of primary raw materials.
The packaging functionality that the following parameters provide to the packaging shall be factored-in in the setting of
design for recycling criteria.
Parameters for design for recycling
criteria Parameter’s relevance
Additives Additives refer often to substances added to materials to confer specific properties. The
presence of additives in the packaging containers can result in incorrect sorting of the
packaging materials during the sorting process and can contaminate the obtained
secondary raw materials.
Labels Coverage rate of labels can affect the efficiency of the sorting process. Material from
which the label is made and type of glue or adhesive also affect the quality of the
secondary raw material.
Sleeves Coverage rate of the sleeve on the main packaging body affects the possibilities for
sorting. In addition, the use of sleeves can affect the ability to separate them from the
main packaging body.
The material from which the sleeve is made can affect both the sortability and the
recyclability of the packaging.
Closures and other small
packaging components
Closures refer to components used to close or seal the packaging. There may be different
types of closures, rigid or flexible, such as tamper-evident shrink wrap, linings, caps, lids,
seals, valves, etc.
The material from which the closures is made can affect both the sortability and the
recyclability of the packaging.
Closures that are not firmly attached to the packaging can increase litter.
Small packaging components attached to the main packaging body can affect the
separability and the recyclability of the packaging. In addition, the components can be
lost in the sorting and recycling process.
Adhesives Adhesives can be used in such a way that they can be easily separated in the recycling
process or by the end user or in a way that they do not affect the efficiency of the sorting
and recycling processes. The presence of adhesive residues on the packaging can
downgrade the quality (purity) of the secondary raw materials.
Washable adhesives can ensure the separation from the main packaging body and that
no adhesive residue remains in the secondary raw material.
OJ L, 22.1.2025 EN
ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj 97/124
Parameters for design for recycling
criteria Parameter’s relevance
Colours Colours are substances that impart colour to the packaging material.
Heavily dyed materials in paper or plastics can cause problems with regard to sorting
and can downgrade the quality of secondary raw materials.
Material composition Use of mono-materials or material combinations that permit easy separation and ensure
high yield of secondary raw materials is preferable.
Barriers / coatings The material or substance added to confer barrier properties (barrier), or a variety of
materials applied on the surface to impart other properties (coating).
The presence of barriers or coatings within the packaging can make recycling more
difficult. Combinations that ensure high yield of secondary raw materials are preferable.
Inks and lacquers / printing/
coding
Inks and lacquers are mixtures of colorants with other substances applied onto the
material by a printing or coating process (ink) or a protective coating made of resin or
cellulose ester, or both, dissolved in a volatile solvent (lacquer). Coding refers to printing
applied directly to sales packaging for the purpose of batch coding and other
information and branding.
The use of inks with substances of concern hinders recycling, as those packaging units
cannot be recycled. Printing inks when released can contaminate the recycling stream
through the washing water. Likewise, printing inks which are not released can impair the
transparency of the recycling stream.
Product residues / ease of
emptying
Residues of the content of the packaging can affect the sortability and the recyclability of
the packaging. The design of the packaging should enable the easy emptying of its
content and when disposed of should be in a fully drained condition.
Ease of dismantling Components that are firmly attached to each other can affect the sortability and the
recyclability of the packaging. Packaging design can facilitate the possibility of separating
different components into different material streams.

ANNEX III
Compostable packaging
Conditions to be considered when mandating or introducing the use of compostable packaging format:
(a) it could not have been designed as reusable packaging or the products could not be placed on the market without
packaging;
(b) it is designed to enter the organic waste stream at the end of its life;
(c) it is of such biodegradable nature that it allows the packaging to undergo physical or biological decomposition,
including anaerobic digestion, resulting ultimately in conversion into carbon dioxide and water, new microbial biomass,
mineral salts, and, in the absence of oxygen, methane;
(d) its use significantly increases the collection of organic waste compared to the use of non-compostable packaging
materials;
(e) its use significantly reduces the contamination of compost with non-compostable packaging and does not cause any
problems in bio-waste processing;
(f) its use does not increase the contamination of non-compostable packaging waste streams.

Methodology for packaging minimisation assessment
Part A
Performance criteria
1. Product protection: packaging design shall ensure protection of the product, from the point of packaging or filling until
its end use, with a view to preventing significant product damage, loss, deterioration or waste. Requirements may consist
of protection against mechanical or chemical damage, vibration, compression, humidity, moisture loss, oxidation, light,
oxygen, microbiological infection, pest, deterioration of organoleptic properties, etc. and include references to specific
Union law setting out requirements on product quality.
2. Packaging manufacturing processes: the packaging design shall be compatible with the packaging manufacturing and
filling processes. The packaging manufacturing processes may determine packaging design elements, such as the shape
of a container, thickness tolerances, size, feasibility of tooling, or specifications minimising waste in manufacturing. The
processes operated by manufacturer of products may also require certain design elements of packaging, such as impact
and stress resistance, mechanical strength, packing line speed and efficiency, stability in conveying, heat resistance,
effective closing, minimum headspace, or hygiene.
3. Logistics: the packaging design shall ensure adequate and safe distribution, transport, handling and warehousing of the
packaged product. Requirements may consist of dimensional coordination for optimum space utilisation, compatibility
with palletising and de-palletising systems, handling and warehousing system, and packaging system integrity during
transport and handling.
4. Packaging functionality: the packaging design shall ensure its functionality, taking into account the purpose of the
product and particularities giving rise to its sale, such as sales for gift purposes, or on the occasion of seasonal events.
5. Information requirements: the packaging design shall ensure that any necessary information regarding the packaged
product itself, its use, storage and care, including safety instructions, can be provided to end users. Requirements may
include providing product information, instructions for storage, application and use, bar codes and the best before date.
6. Hygiene and safety: the packaging design shall ensure user and consumer safety as well as product safety and hygiene
throughout the distribution, end use and disposal of the packaged product. Requirements may include those on safe
handling design, child resistance, anti-tamper, anti-theft, anti-counterfeit, hazard warnings, clear identification of
content, safe opening device or pressure-release closure.
7. Legal requirements: the packaging design shall ensure that the packaging and packaged product can comply with
applicable law.
8. Recycled content, recyclability and re-use: the packaging design shall ensure reusability, recyclability and inclusion of
recycled content as required under this Regulation. If the packaging is intended for re-use, it shall fulfil the requirements
laid down in Article 11(1). This means that the packaging weight or volume may have to be increased beyond what
would otherwise be possible under the other performance factors in order to enable for example a higher number of
trips or rotations, to facilitate inclusion of recycled content or to enhance recyclability (for example when moving to
a mono-material or post-consumer recycled content).
Part B
Assessment methodology and determination of the minimum packaging volume and weight
The assessment of the minimum packaging volume and weight necessary to ensure the packaging functionality as described
in Article 3(1), point (1), shall be explained in the technical documentation and shall include at least:
EN OJ L, 22.1.2025
100/124 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/40/oj
(a) the description of the outcome of the assessment, including the details of the calculation of the minimum necessary
weight and volume for the packaging; possible variations between production batches for a same packaging shall be
taken into account and documented;
(b) for each performance criterion as listed in Part A, a description which explains the design requirement that prevents
further reduction of the packaging weight or volume without endangering the packaging functionality, including safety
and hygiene, for the packaged product, packaging and user; the method used for the identification of these design
requirements shall be described, and the reasons preventing further reduction of the packaging weight or volume shall
be explained; all reduction opportunities with a given packaging material shall be investigated, such as the reduction of
any superfluous layer which does not perform a packaging function; substitution of one packaging material with
another shall not be considered sufficient;
(c) any test results, market research or studies that have been used for the assessment conducted under points (a) and (b).
