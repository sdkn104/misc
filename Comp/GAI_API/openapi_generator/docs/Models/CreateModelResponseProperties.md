## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **metadata** | **Map** | Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.   Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **temperature** | **BigDecimal** | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or &#x60;top_p&#x60; but not both.  | [optional] [default to 1] |
| **top\_p** | **BigDecimal** | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.  We generally recommend altering this or &#x60;temperature&#x60; but not both.  | [optional] [default to 1] |
| **user** | **String** | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids).  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **service\_tier** | [**ServiceTier**](ServiceTier.md) |  | [optional] [default to null] |
