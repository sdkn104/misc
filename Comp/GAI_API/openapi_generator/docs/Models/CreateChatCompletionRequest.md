# CreateChatCompletionRequest
## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **metadata** | **Map** | Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.   Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **temperature** | **BigDecimal** | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or &#x60;top_p&#x60; but not both.  | [optional] [default to 1] |
| **top\_p** | **BigDecimal** | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.  We generally recommend altering this or &#x60;temperature&#x60; but not both.  | [optional] [default to 1] |
| **user** | **String** | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids).  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **service\_tier** | [**ServiceTier**](ServiceTier.md) |  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **messages** | [**List**](ChatCompletionRequestMessage.md) | A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Depending on the [model](/docs/models) you use, different message types (modalities) are supported, like [text](/docs/guides/text-generation), [images](/docs/guides/vision), and [audio](/docs/guides/audio).  | [default to null] |
| **model** | [**ModelIdsShared**](ModelIdsShared.md) |  | [default to null] |
| **modalities** | **List** | Output types that you would like the model to generate. Most models are capable of generating text, which is the default:  &#x60;[\&quot;text\&quot;]&#x60;  The &#x60;gpt-4o-audio-preview&#x60; model can also be used to  [generate audio](/docs/guides/audio). To request that this model generate  both text and audio responses, you can use:  &#x60;[\&quot;text\&quot;, \&quot;audio\&quot;]&#x60;  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **reasoning\_effort** | [**ReasoningEffort**](ReasoningEffort.md) |  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **max\_completion\_tokens** | **Integer** | An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion, including visible output tokens and [reasoning tokens](/docs/guides/reasoning).  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **frequency\_penalty** | **BigDecimal** | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model&#39;s likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.  | [optional] [default to 0] |
| **presence\_penalty** | **BigDecimal** | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model&#39;s likelihood to talk about new topics.  | [optional] [default to 0] |
| **web\_search\_options** | [**Web_search**](Web_search.md) |  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **top\_logprobs** | **Integer** | An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. &#x60;logprobs&#x60; must be set to &#x60;true&#x60; if this parameter is used.  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **response\_format** | [**CreateChatCompletionRequest_allOf_response_format**](CreateChatCompletionRequest_allOf_response_format.md) |  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **audio** | [**CreateChatCompletionRequest_allOf_audio**](CreateChatCompletionRequest_allOf_audio.md) |  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **store** | **Boolean** | Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for  use in our [model distillation](/docs/guides/distillation) or [evals](/docs/guides/evals) products.  | [optional] [default to false] |
| **stream** | **Boolean** | If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format). See the [Streaming section below](/docs/api-reference/chat/streaming) for more information, along with the [streaming responses](/docs/guides/streaming-responses) guide for more information on how to handle the streaming events.  | [optional] [default to false] |
| **stop** | [**StopConfiguration**](StopConfiguration.md) |  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **logit\_bias** | **Map** | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.  Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **logprobs** | **Boolean** | Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the &#x60;content&#x60; of &#x60;message&#x60;.  | [optional] [default to false] |
| **max\_tokens** | **Integer** | The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat completion. This value can be used to control [costs](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for text generated via API.  This value is now deprecated in favor of &#x60;max_completion_tokens&#x60;, and is not compatible with [o-series models](/docs/guides/reasoning).  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **n** | **Integer** | How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep &#x60;n&#x60; as &#x60;1&#x60; to minimize costs. | [optional] [default to 1] |
| **prediction** | [**PredictionContent**](PredictionContent.md) |  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **seed** | **Integer** | This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same &#x60;seed&#x60; and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the &#x60;system_fingerprint&#x60; response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **stream\_options** | [**ChatCompletionStreamOptions**](ChatCompletionStreamOptions.md) |  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **tools** | [**List**](ChatCompletionTool.md) | A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **tool\_choice** | [**ChatCompletionToolChoiceOption**](ChatCompletionToolChoiceOption.md) |  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **parallel\_tool\_calls** | **Boolean** | Whether to enable [parallel function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling#configuring-parallel-function-calling) during tool use. | [optional] [default to true] |
| **function\_call** | [**CreateChatCompletionRequest_allOf_function_call**](CreateChatCompletionRequest_allOf_function_call.md) |  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **functions** | [**List**](ChatCompletionFunctions.md) | Deprecated in favor of &#x60;tools&#x60;.  A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.  | [optional] [default to null] |
